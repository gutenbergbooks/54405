<p>Max Pemberton in the <cite>Sphere</cite>:&mdash;“… Will be read and reread
by all who have toured Wales a-wheel. Mrs. Stawell is a
charming writer; she has a fine sense of the road, and she
adds to it a literary insight that is always captivating.… I
have rarely encountered a book so full of pleasant literary
gossip and yet so very practical.”&mdash;&mdash;<cite>World</cite>:&mdash;“This most
artistic book … gives a sympathetic description of all that
is worth seeing in Shropshire, North Wales, the Heart of
Wales, South Wales, and the Wye Valley. I do not think I
have ever seen such beautifully-arranged photographs in any
book of travel.”</p>

<p>“This charmingly-written account of motor travels in Yorkshire
has no feature in common with the ordinary dry-as-dust
matter of fact guide-book. The volume is one of the most
fascinating books of home travel, within its own assigned
limits, with which we are acquainted.… Full of exquisitely
finished photographs.”&mdash;<cite>Standard.</cite>&mdash;&mdash;“Motorists require a
new order of guide-book, which shall be as independent of
show places and beaten tracks as the happy possessor of a
car. Mrs. Stawell has gauged by practical experience the
new requirements, and has now done for the county of
broad acres what her previous volume did for the
Principality.”&mdash;<cite>Outlook.</cite></p>

<p class="center bold">MOTOR TOURS IN THE WEST COUNTRY</p>

<p class="center u">With 48 Illustrations from Photographs, and Map.</p>

<p>In common with Mrs. Rodolph Stawell’s other books of Motor
Tours, this delightful volume is specially written for those who
like to know something of the history and antiquities of the
places through which they pass, and for lovers of beautiful
scenery. At the same time all the principal roads of Devon
and Cornwall are discussed in considerable detail, and though
Somerset is not fully dealt with, there are two chapters on
that county. Each chapter is preceded by a summary of
distances, &amp;c. The book is illustrated by 48 photographs by
R. de S. Stawell, and contains an index and map of the routes.</p>

<p>To most of us the very thought of the
West Country is full of enchantment.
In this grey and strenuous island, where
a man must move quickly if he would
be warm, this is the nearest approach
to a Lotus Land&mdash;a land of green hills and
hollows all lapped in an emerald sea, a
land where the breezes are sleepy and
scented, and the flowers grow because they
want to see the view, and the sunshine is
really encouraging, and the very rain is
soft and kind. Even here the weather has
its moods; but they are all lovable, and in
any case cannot touch our happy memories.
We who are but wayfarers, and have chanced
to see the sun shining on the blue distances
of Dartmoor, and warming the little sandy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
coves of South Devon, and peering into the
depths of the wooded valley of Lynmouth,
and lighting up the dark granite of the
Land’s End, may keep the remembrance of
it unspoiled for ever. Like the figures on
Keats’ Grecian Urn, our vision of sunny hours
suffers no change. “For ever shalt thou
love, and she be fair.”</p>

<p>Even in Somerset the spell begins to work.
We feel at once there is no need for haste.
We begin to loiter, and stray from the
straight path, and saunter through the
orchards of the “Summerland;” though all
the time the thought of the Devon border
is never absent from our minds.</p>

<p>Very slowly the car creeps over Clifton
Suspension Bridge. The Avon, a long way
below us, flows between its high red-and-white
cliffs towards the Severn Sea, to
whose shore we too are bound before we
turn southwards and make our leisurely
way to Exeter, through Cheddar, and Glastonbury,
and Chard.</p>

<p>It is a fairly hilly road that takes us by
way of Failand to Clevedon. The surface
is a little rough, too, but this is unfortunately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
a quality that is shared by many of the roads
of Somerset. After passing through some
pleasant scenery&mdash;here a dark plantation,
and there a wide landscape bounded by the
grey waters of the Bristol Channel, and here
on the slope a pretty village&mdash;it leads us into
the bright, clean, breezy streets that have
been trodden by Coleridge and Thackeray
and the Brookfields, by Tennyson and the
Hallams.</p>

<p>When Coleridge came to Clevedon with his
bride, and “only such furniture as became
a philosopher,” there was no more than a
village here. There was no esplanade, nor
pier, nor bandstand to try his philosophy,
when he took the one-storied cottage with
the jasmine-covered porch and the tall rose
that peeped in at the window, and settled
there with the woman whom he loved “best
of all created things” and by whom he
was bored at the end of two months.
Except in the matter of the jasmine on the
porch, and the garden that contains&mdash;in the
words of the sarcastic Cottle&mdash;“several pretty
flowers,” there is little likeness between the
Coleridge Cottage in the Old Church Road<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
and the poet’s “Valley of Seclusion.” Local
tradition would have us believe, however,
that this red-tiled cottage with the two
sentinel trees is the very one that “possessed
everything that heart could desire”&mdash;for two
months; the one that was supplied at the
philosopher’s request with a dustpan and a
small tin kettle, a Bible and a keg of porter;
the one in which poor Sara sat so often by
herself, uncheered even by Mr. Cottle’s gift
of “several pieces of sprightly wall-paper.”</p>

<p>In those days Clevedon Court, which we
passed as we drove into the town, was really
in the country, no doubt. It is still shaded
and sheltered by trees, and its mellow walls,
its stately arches and mullions and terraces,
contrive to keep an air of academic calm
in defiance of the highway that passes near
them, and of the neat little villas that make
modern Clevedon look so tidy. If we should
chance to be here on Thursday we may see
the gardens. The rare beauty of this ancient
house is inevitably tinged with sadness now;
but it was not sad, we may be sure, when
boyish Brookfield did his wooing here, and
Thackeray paced these paths, as novelists<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
use, with the visionary Henry Esmond at
his elbow, and Tennyson walked with Arthur
Hallam among the flowers, and there was as
yet no tablet “glimmering to the dawn” in
the dark church on the cliff.</p>

<p>Quite solitary still, and undisturbed by
any sound but the faint murmur of the sea,
is the grey church “by the broad water of the
west” where Arthur Hallam lies. It must
always have been a desolate, haunting spot,
even before the song of the sea became a
dirge and the old walls were consecrated
anew to the memory of a poet’s sorrow. In
those days, doubtless, the fragments of Saxon
work and the moulding of the chancel-arch
received more attention than now, when
every eye wanders instantly to the white
tablet on the wall of the south transept, and
every foot is fain to stand where Tennyson
stood with his bride, above the grave of
Arthur Hallam and his father.</p>

<p>From Clevedon, turning inland to Wells, we
cross a level land of orchards and meadows on
a very poor surface, through Yatton with its
curious church-tower, and Congresbury with
its old cross-steps, and Churchill with its historic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
name. Before us is the long shoulder of
the Mendips, changing from blue to green as
we pass Churchill and climb, on a road that
suddenly becomes good, through a gap in the
hills. There are fine views from these uplands,
and here and there a glimpse, far
behind us, of the Severn estuary. Very slowly
we drive through the narrow, winding streets
of Axbridge, shadowed by overhanging eaves
and gables of every height and angle; and
quickly through the level strawberry fields
beyond, to Cheddar under the hills.</p>

<p class="caption">CHEDDAR GORGE.</p>

</div>

<p>Cheddar Gorge is a surprising&mdash;almost a
startling&mdash;place, and we must leave our highway
for a little time to see it. From the
village at the foot of the Mendips a road&mdash;and
a very good road it is&mdash;climbs to the table-land
above through a natural cleft between two
mighty cliffs, which rise sheer from the roadway
and stand out against the sky in a mass
of towers and pinnacles. And all this sternness
is softened and made beautiful by hanging
draperies of green. Masses of ivy trail
from crag to crag; high overhead the little
birch-trees find a precarious footing on invisible
ledges; every tiny cleft and ridge holds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
a line of grass and wildflowers across the
grey face of the cliff. Gradually, as the
road sweeps higher, the towering sides of
the gorge change into steep slopes of grass
and fern, strewn with boulders and broken
here and there by clumps of firs. The slopes
become lower and lower, more and more
open, till at last the landscape widens into
undulating fields. Then we turn, and glide
down again round curve after curve, while
the grandeur grows, as the huge walls of the
gorge close in upon us and reach their climax
in the Pinnacle Rocks.</p>

<p>And deep in the heart of these wild cliffs
is a strange, uncanny world. Surely in these
caverns the gnomes ran riot till they were
frightened away by an elaborate system of
electric lighting and an exuberance of advertisement.
It is plain that they have left
Gough’s Cave, for it is more than a little artificial;
but none the less there is an ethereal
beauty in the myriad stalactites and stalagmites
through which the light gleams so softly
on roof and floor. As for the poor prehistoric
man who guards the entrance of the cave
that has served him for dwelling-house and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
tomb, it is an indignity for him, I think,
after his seventy thousand years or so of
rest in the heart of the earth, to be set
up thus in a glass case to grin at tourists.</p>

<p>Between Cheddar and Wells a pretty, winding,
undulating road dips in and out of
several red-roofed villages shaded by trees.
In the distance the unmistakable outline of
Glastonbury Tor is dark against the sky.</p>

<p>This is not the best way into Wells, for
the cathedral is hidden. It is from the Shepton
Mallet road that we may see “the toune
of Wells,” as John Leland saw it nearly four
hundred years ago, “sette yn the rootes of
Mendepe hille in a stony soile and ful of
springes.” It has not changed very much:
the clergy here being secular, the Dissolution
did not affect them, and Wells has
never greatly concerned itself with worldly
matters and has been all the more peaceful
on that account. There have been disturbing
moments, of course; as when Perkin Warbeck
set up his claim, so confusing to the
minds of quiet folk; and when the Parliament-men
made havoc in the cathedral;
and when Prince Maurice and his troops<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
were billeted on the town, to its great impoverishment;
and when King Monmouth
passed this way. But on the whole Wells
has suffered little. Leland, when he visited
the cathedral, entered the close by one of
these gates that are standing to-day: came
through the Chain Gate, under the gallery
and past the great clock that was made by
a monk of Glastonbury, or through Browne’s
Gate from Sadler Street, or on foot through
Penniless Porch in the corner, once the haunt
of beggars; and saw Jocelin’s famous west
front rising above the greensward, with
the embattled deanery hard by; and passed
from the market-place to the moated palace
under the archway of Beckington’s “right
goodly gatehouse,” the Bishop’s Eye. This
fifteenth-century Bishop Beckington did
much for the beauty and benefit of Wells;
built, not only three gateways, but also “xij
right exceding fair houses al uniforme of
stone, high and fair windoid,” in the market-place,
and set a conduit there, “for the which
the burgeses ons a yere solemply visite his
tumbe, and pray for hys sowle.”</p>

<p>We may visit his tomb ourselves. His dust<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
lies in the cathedral at the entrance to the
choir, beyond that ugly inverted arch that
was set up for safety’s sake in the fourteenth
century; but in later days his tomb has been
treated less reverently than of yore. Its
carved and painted canopy stands broken
and empty in the chapel of St. Calixtus, and
in the south aisle of the choir is the rather
ghastly tomb&mdash;bishop above and skeleton
below&mdash;which the burgesses visited so gratefully.
It is a rare and delightful custom
here that allows one to walk alone through
the choir and exquisite lady-chapel; to linger
at will by the throne where William Laud
and Thomas Ken have sat; to picture Lord
Grey standing with drawn sword before this
altar, to defend it from the rabble that
followed Monmouth; to seek out Bishop
Button’s tomb, which cured so many mediæval
toothaches; to mount the long flight
of footworn steps to the chapter-house, and
rest beneath its lovely vault in silence. These
same steps lead also to the gallery that was
built by Beckington for the use of the priest-vicars,
whose peaceful close is reached by a
gateway of its own, outside the Chain Gate.</p>

<p class="caption">THE BISHOP’S EYE, WELLS.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>Beyond the cloisters is the palace: the
fortified gatehouse, the towers and drawbridge
that Ralph of Shrewsbury found it
wise to set between himself and the citizens;
the moat that is filled every day from St.
Andrew’s Well; the shattered banquet-hall
where Edward III. once ate his Christmas
dinner; the great red dwelling-house that
has passed for nearly seven centuries from
hand to hand. “Many bisshops hath bene
the makers of it, as it is now,” says Leland.
It has had Wolsey for its master though not
its inmate; it has been stolen by Somerset
the Protector; it has been the home of
Bishop Laud. Saintly Thomas Ken went
from its seclusion for a little time to join
the rest of the Seven Bishops in the wild
uproar of their trial and acquittal, and later
on was driven from its doors by William
of Orange. Here is Ken’s summer-house, at
the upper corner of the garden that he loved.
Local tradition, whose wish is usually father
to its thought, declares that he wrote his
Evening Hymn in this little summer-house
at the end of the terrace; but history, I
believe, says otherwise. It is tradition, too,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
that accuses Bishop Barlow of stripping the
lead from the roof of the banquet-hall, whose
great windows we see so plainly from this
terrace. Barlow’s misdeeds at St. David’s
have given him a well-deserved bad name;
but, on this occasion only, he was more sinned
against than sinning, for the palace and
many other things were wrung from him
by Protector Somerset, from whom they
passed to one Sir John Gates. This vandal
was the destroyer of the banquet-hall, and
would probably have done more mischief
than he did, if he had not been most justifiably
beheaded.</p>

<p>It is behind the palace that we find the
loveliest spot in Wells. Here, overlooked
by sixteenth-century oriels, are the springs
that long ago gave the city its name&mdash;the
wells of St. Andrew, whose still surface has
reflected for hundreds of years the beautiful
east end of the cathedral. For hundreds
of years, too, its waters have fed the moat.
It is only at certain hours, of course, that
strangers may walk in the palace garden;
but the moat that circles it and the towers
that guard it are visible to everyone. So<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
is the swan who rings for his dinner when
it is late, with all the jerky impatience of
a man in the same plight.</p>

<p class="caption">WELLS CATHEDRAL.</p>

</div>

<p>There is something that takes a hold on
the imagination in the very dulness of the
country that lies between Wells and Glastonbury.
For the reason that this road with
the rough surface is so level, and has such
uninteresting surroundings, is that all this
country was once the swampy land that lay
round the Isle of Avalon. There is Glastonbury
Tor before us, conspicuous for many
a mile with its steep sides and crowning
tower; and here on our left is the orchard-clad
slope of Avalon itself, where “golden
apples smile in every wood.”</p>

<p>We drive slowly down the long High Street
of Glastonbury.</p>

<p>Many, many pilgrims have come this way
before us: have passed the great Tudor-rose
and mullioned windows of the old stone
court-house on the right, have stopped
before the panelled front, the wreathed
vines and carven beasts, of the “George” Inn,
and have entered it beneath the painted
arms of Edward IV. For this inn is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
New Guesthouse that Abbot Selwood built
and embattled and made so fine, for such
of the pilgrims as paid for their lodging.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
It was Selwood’s successor, Abbot Bere, “a
grave, wise, and discreet man, just and upright
in all his ways,” who raised the grey
Tribunal that has been in turn an abbot’s
court-house, a boys’ school, and a lawyer’s
office. Exactly opposite this house is the
passage that leads to the abbey.</p>

<p>It is not in the stones of Glastonbury
that we shall find her history; not in this
soaring broken arch that leads our eyes
and our hearts upwards; nor even in the
splendours of arcading and moulding that
are the glory of the <i>Ealde Chirche</i>, the
chapel usually called St. Joseph’s, though it
is really St. Mary’s. Many centuries before
these walls were raised, many centuries
before Norman hands ever laid one English
stone upon another, the soil beneath our
feet&mdash;this dust that is the dust of saints
and kings&mdash;was held sacred by Saxon and
Celt. “This place,” says Camden, “was by
our Ancestors call’d the first ground of God,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
the first ground of the Saints in England,
the rise and fountain of all religion in
England, the burying-place of the Saints,
the mother of the Saints.”</p>

<p class="caption">ST. MARY’S CHAPEL (OFTEN CALLED ST. JOSEPH’S), GLASTONBURY.</p>

</div>

<p>The mind loses itself here in a cloud of
legend. Dim forms of early saint and holy
grail give place to visions, almost as dim,
of St. Patrick and St. David and St. Bridget.
Every holy man and woman came to Glastonbury,
according to the chroniclers, sooner
or later, alive or dead; so that the very floor,
says William of Malmesbury, and the sides
of the altar, and even the altar itself above
and beneath, were laden with the multitude
of relics. From Northumbria, from
Ireland, from Wales, came the bones of
the saints in search of safety: Paulinus
and Aidan and Bede, and Hilda from her
wild cliff by the North Sea, and David
from his Rosy Valley in the west. How
much of this is true we not know and need
not greatly care, seeing that in any case
the fact that gives interest and beauty to
these stories is the fact of Glastonbury’s
immense age and sanctity, the undoubted
fact that it was “the first ground of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
Saints in England, the burying-place of
Saints, the mother of Saints.” We may
even be informed by some officious person
that the real name of the Glastonbury
Thorn is <i>Cratægus oxycantha præcox</i>, and
that it will blossom at Christmas elsewhere;
yet nothing can rob us of the picture of
Henry VIII.’s lying and thieving commissioner,
when he came hither to despoil and
desecrate, carefully wrapping up two sprigs of
the sacred thorn in a piece of white sarcenet,
and sending them as a present to Thomas
Cromwell; nor of that other picture of
the zealous puritan, solemnly hacking the
thorn-tree to death for the good of his
soul.</p>

<p>When St. Dunstan was a boy, living here
in the primitive monastery founded by King
Ina, he dreamt that he saw, on this spot
where we are standing among the ruins,
a glorious fabric of “fair alleys and comely
cloisters.” The splendours of his vision have
come and gone, but we too may see them
in dream: the mighty church with its towering
arches, its many chapels, its marble
floors and sapphire altar; the enclosing wall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
with the two great entrances; the acres of
domestic buildings&mdash;cloisters and dormitories,
library and refectory, and the abbot’s stately
lodging. Over there among the trees his
kitchen still stands. The steam of much
good cheer rose to its quaint octagonal roof
when Henry VII. was here as the guest of
that wise and discreet man, Abbot Bere;
and when Leland visited his “especial friend,”
Richard Whiting; and when Henry VIII.’s
commissioner came on his mean errand,
and found to his annoyance that the brethren
were “so straight kept that they could not
offend.”</p>

<p>It was not the magnificent building of
Dunstan’s dream, but the simple church he
knew, that was the burial-place of kings.
He himself, as abbot, laid Edmund the Elder
in his grave; and here in the monastery
“which he ever loved beyond all others” lies
Edgar the Pacific, “the flower and pride of
all kings, the honour and glory of England,”
and near him his grandson Edmund Ironside,
who was merciful and kind, says
Matthew of Westminster, “to the just
persons in his kingdom, and terrible to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
unjust.… And all England mourned for
him exceedingly.” And somewhere deep
beneath the turf, near the spot where the
high altar used to stand, is the dust of
those bones and that golden tress of hair
that some would have us believe were the
actual remains of Arthur and Guinevere.
Edward I. and his Eleanor believed it, and
came to the great church here when it
was new to gaze, adoring and credulous,
at the skulls of their predecessors. But
now our minds&mdash;like that of the blameless
king himself&mdash;are “clouded with a doubt”:
for the historic Arthur, we are told, died
almost certainly in Scotland, and never came
to the Island Valley of Avilion to heal him
of his grievous wound.</p>

<p>The first Norman abbot of Glastonbury,
Thurstan, set to work at once to improve
the old building, and would have done more
if his abbacy had not suddenly ended in an
unseemly skirmish on the very steps of the
altar. “He would have taught the monks
amiss,” says the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle
severely. In point of fact he was resolved
to abolish the use of Gregorian chants, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
the great scandal of the monks, and, like
many another, thought that the introduction
of the soldiery would have a convincing
effect. “Rueful things happened there on
that day,” says the chronicler, “for the
French broke into the choir and threw
darts towards the altar where the monks
were collected, and some of their servants
went upon the upper floor and shot down
arrows towards the chancel, so that many
arrows stuck in the crucifix which stood
above the altar, and the wretched monks
lay around the altar, and some crept under
it … and they slew some of the monks
and wounded many, so that the blood ran
down from the altar on the steps.” Rueful
things indeed!</p>

<p>The dogmatic Thurstan was removed, and
a year later the monastery was burnt to the
ground. It was then that this beautiful
chapel began to rise, with all its profusion
of ornament; and round it for hundreds of
years the great abbey continued to grow
slowly into the perfection of Dunstan’s
dream. How great was the magnificence
of it we may judge from the “dyverse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
parcells” that were ultimately “delyvered
until his Majestie”&mdash;the spoils of many
shrines, gold and silver vessels, jewelled
altars, and “the great saphire of Glastonburg.”
Poor Abbot Whiting did his best to
save them before he went to his death on
Glastonbury Tor.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;" id="illus6">

<p class="caption">THE CHOIR, GLASTONBURY.</p>

</div>

<p>There is Glastonbury Tor before us, framed
in the piers of the broken chancel-arch. It
was to the summit of that hill that Richard
Whiting, last Abbot of Glastonbury, who had
been wont to travel in all the pomp of a
prince, was dragged upon a hurdle to the
gallows. Over the great gate through which
his guests had so often crowded&mdash;sometimes
five hundred in a day, they say&mdash;his head was
set up, lest men should forget that the King
loved “parcells of gilte plate” more than
justice. For there was hardly a pretence of
justice in the trial of Richard Whiting. Like
the Abbot of Fountains, he hid the treasures
of his abbey from the King’s commissioners,
and, since he must be proved a traitor before
these riches could be wrung from him, this
act was called high treason. Neither his
immense charities, nor his simple, saintly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
life, nor even his submission to the Act of
Supremacy could save him. It was with
“businesslike brevity,” says Green the
historian, that Thomas Cromwell “ticked
off human lives.” “Item,” he wrote among
his memoranda, “the abbot of Glaston to
be tryed at Glaston and also executyd
there.” So Richard Whiting was hanged
and quartered at the foot of that tower that
still stands upon the hill, and serves him
for a monument.</p>

<p>I am not sure whether the main entrance
to the abbey, over which Whiting’s head was
set, was the vanished gateway on the north
side, or the still existing entrance in
Magdalen Street. We pass the latter as
we drive out of the town. Its newly
restored archway stands on the left, beside
the house that was once the “Red Lion” Inn,
and quite close to the modern market-cross
that is so unusually graceful. Our road
skirts the foot of Wearyall Hill, where once
the sacred thorn-tree grew&mdash;the miraculous
tree that had been, said the monks of
Glastonbury, the staff of Joseph of Arimathea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>After a few minutes of level running we
climb the Polden Hills&mdash;no very arduous
work&mdash;and look down upon the wide green
plain of Sedgemoor. It lies on our right
as we glide down the hill, and stretches far
away from us to Bridgwater. It was from
some spot in that blue distance that “a
volley of shot and huzzas” rang out into the
night, when Monmouth and his peasant army
made their futile attempt to “vindicate their
religion, laws, and rights;” and it was far
away across those level fields that Feversham’s
grim line of gibbets rose on the
following day. In all this peaceful country
there was not a ditch from which some poor
wretch was not dragged to make sport,
later on, for Jeffreys: but the ditch that
hid Monmouth himself was not here, but
in Dorset. As we look out upon the scene
of his undoing let us forget that distant
ditch, and the weakness of an exhausted,
starving man, and remember only that he
made a gallant end. “I shall die like a
lamb,” he said on the scaffold. “I have now
no fear, as you may see by my face; but
there is something within me which does<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
it, for I am sure I shall go to God. I will
make no speeches: I come to die.”</p>

<p>Again the road is level, or nearly so; but,
as is rare in level country, the surface is bad.
We pass under the railway-bridge of the new
Great Western line, and soon see Somerton
on the crest of a hill. The road to Ilchester
climbs the hill at the outskirts of the town,
without actually passing through it; but it
would be a pity to turn our backs on the
ancient capital of the Somersœtas without
a glance at its picturesque streets and old
houses, whose mellow walls are so characteristic
of Somerset. In the silent square that
was once dominated by the castle, and is now
made beautiful by an arcaded, stone-tiled
market-cross, there is nothing to show that
Somerton is a town of varied experiences.
It has seen a vast amount of life, but prefers
to say nothing about it.</p>

<p>Here where the “White Hart” stands, without
a sign of age, once stood the palace of
King Ina and his pious wife. Ina, King of
the West Saxons, was “a rare example of
fortitude,” we are told; “a mirror of
prudence, unequalled in piety”&mdash;though he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
ascended the throne, as the same chronicler
delicately expresses it, “more from the innate
activity of his spirit than any legitimate
right of succession.” Active he certainly
was: a conqueror of the British, a builder
of monasteries and churches and castles.
We meet the records of his activities at
Wells and Glastonbury, at Taunton, and
here in Somerton; and even when his
determined Ethelburga had persuaded him
to abdicate, with some reluctance, he continued
to build in Rome. It was on this
hill he chiefly lived and made his laws, I
believe, but his castle was burnt by the
destroying Danish princes, Hinguar and
Hubba. On its foundations rose the later
castle that served as a prison for King John
of France; but even this has left no remnant
but some thick masonry in the modest walls
of the “White Hart.” In this scene of long
past revelry and war there is hardly a sign of
life. Somerton is inhabited, apparently, by
one man, two children, and a cat.</p>

<p class="caption">MARKET PLACE, SOMERTON.</p>

</div>

<p>Through cornfields and orchards and over
Kingsdon Hill, on a surface that is gradually
improving, we go on our way to a town that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
is older still than Somerton, but by no means
so attractive. Indeed, Ilchester has a very
dull air, though it stands on the Fosse Way
and has a few relics of its Roman origin.
A little more than two hundred years ago,
however, its sombre streets were lively
enough on a certain August day, when gay
young Monmouth rode through them on a
carpet of flowers and scented herbs, and
the crowd swept after him along the narrow
ways. What schemes for the future were
in his mind we cannot guess, but at this
time&mdash;during his father’s life&mdash;there was
nothing on his lips more treasonable than
the smiles that made the people love him. He
had come “into the country to divert himself,”
and for a week or two all these lanes round
Ilchester and Ilminster, Chard and Yeovil,
were ringing with cheers. “God bless King
Charles and the protestant Duke,” the people
shouted, as he rode smiling between these
hedges. For he, like ourselves, left Ilchester
by the Roman road, which was probably even
more badly kept in those days than in these.
It has, of course, the charm&mdash;in a motorist’s
eyes&mdash;of straightness, but the irregular fringe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
of grass at the sides gives it an unkempt air
that is unworthy of its origin, and it is only
in patches that the surface is good. The
abrupt hill on the left with the tower on its
summit is the “sharp mount” that gave its
name to Montacute.</p>

<p>We turn away from the Roman road by
a lane that climbs a long hill between high
hedges, and quickly runs down again. Below
us, in a fold of the low hills, lies Crewkerne.</p>

<p>Joshua Sprigge, in his enchanting history,
“compiled for the Publique good, and to be
sold at the Parot in Paul’s Churchyard,”
describes how the army of the Parliament
came to <em>Crookhorn</em> by “ill and narrow”
ways in a very hot season, “the foot weary
with their long and tedious march, the carriage-horses
tyred out;” and how, only an
hour later, they left it again with all their
weariness forgotten. “They leapt for joy
that they were like to be engaged.” As they
were following the enemy to Petherton it
was probably by this very road that they
marched away, probably on this very road
that Fairfax and Cromwell came riding side
by side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>We need not stay in Crewkerne even so
long as they, for there is nothing to be seen
except the church. There is hardly a church
in Somerset that is not worth seeing, either
for its beauty or its interest; but the church
here is more than ordinarily stately. Like
all the rest it is built of the stone whose
grey and yellow tints make even the simplest
cottage in Somerset a lovely thing, and
add greatly to the beauty of this elaborate
church, with its crockets and statues and
niches, its embattled turrets and parapet,
and all its intricate gargoyles. In an angle
of the south transept is a curious recess such
as I have never seen elsewhere, with a canopy
and a stone seat. It is said to have been a
hermit’s cell; but a hermit who frequented
the outer wall of a large church must have
been very fond of society.</p>

<p>Here we strike the London and Exeter
road, and therefore the surface, which has
hitherto been indifferent at best and at
worst very bad, becomes almost perfect. As
we climb the long hill of St. Rayne to the
height that is ominously known as Windwhistle,
the scenery grows very lovely: the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
breezy road passes along a ridge, a wide
park skirts the wayside, and to right and
left the landscape sweeps away into the
distance. Indeed, I have heard that at one
point near Windwhistle inn&mdash;at the fourth
milestone from Chard&mdash;it is possible on a
clear day to catch a glimpse of the two seas,
to north and south. A run of two miles
on an easy downward gradient takes us to
the “prepared” road that leads into the
long, wide, sloping street of Chard; then a
steep climb lifts us to the hilltops again;
and a few minutes later we glide down into
the soft green woods of Devon.</p>

<h3>II<br />
THE HEART OF DEVON</h3>

<p>To hurry in Devonshire is absurd. In
the first place, it is contrary to the
spirit of the country: no one does it. In
the second place, it is impossible.</p>

<p>I cannot conscientiously recommend Devon
as a motoring field for those who find
great speed essential to their happiness, for
to them the alternate use of the gear
lever and the brake is apt to be exasperating.
But to many of us the reduction of
our average mileage is a small matter in
comparison with certain important things;
such as scarlet poppies in the corn, and
high banks fringed with ferns, and cottages
smothered in flowers, and wide purple moors,
and the rippling of emerald seas, and the
complete serenity that fills the heart in Devon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>Here, on the very border, there is a long
rise and an extremely sharp turn, on the
hill where Yarcombe stands. After this
winding climb we run down easily through
lovely wooded country into the straight,
wide street of Honiton. This is a name that
rouses deep emotion in every female heart,
and to the female ear I will confide the fact
that Honiton lace, as made to-day in Honiton,
is perhaps more really beautiful than it has
ever been; and there is a certain little upper
room, not hard to find, where the enthusiast
may watch swift fingers and flying bobbins.
Except these filmy bramble-leaves and roses
there is nothing of interest in Honiton. Sir
William Pole summed it up three centuries
ago, and his words describe it accurately to
this day. “This towne is a very prety
towne indifferently well bwilded, and hath
his market on the Saterday.”</p>

<p>By the direct road Exeter is only fifteen
miles away, but by making quite a short
<i lang="fr">détour</i> we may see the birthplaces of Coleridge
and Sir Walter Raleigh, and catch a
glimpse of the sea. A mile or two of
splendid Roman road, and a shady lane,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
take us to Ottery St. Mary and its famous
church; the church, says Pole, that John
Grandison, Bishop of Exeter, “bwilded in
imitatinge of ye church of St. Peter’s in
Exon, with ye cannons’ howses round about,
standinge in a sweete wholsom advanced
ground.” He did not actually “bwild” it,
however, but rather enlarged it and made it
collegiate, and left upon it the marks of
that taste for splendour in which he indulged
more fully at Exeter. Not only a great
part of the fabric itself is his, but the
painted reredos and the stone screen and
the choir-stalls were his gifts. The pulpit
is of a much more modern date; but it is
the very same from which Coleridge’s father
was in the habit of addressing his congregation
in Hebrew, “the authentic language of
the Holy Ghost.” The grammar-school in
which the poet spent his childhood with
his twelve brethren no longer exists; but
we may still see the narrow lanes where
little Samuel, a visionary already, curvetted
on an imaginary horse and slew the enemies
of Christendom as represented by the wayside
nettle. And here, close at hand, is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
little Otter, and the “marge with willows
grey” by which he loved to dream.</p>

<p>Long before Coleridge played his warlike
games there were horsemen of a sterner
sort riding hither and thither through these
lanes. Fairfax spent a busy fortnight here,
resting his army, “who never stood in more
need of it,” but by no means resting himself:
visiting the works at Broad Clyst,
caring for his dying soldiers, and doing his
best to make peace between King and Parliament.
“To be general raised him onely to
<em>do</em> more, not to <em>be</em> more than others,” said
a man who was with him here. Where he
lodged I do not know, nor the spot where
he was presented with a “fair jewel” in the
name of both Houses, in gratitude for the
services “he performed for this kingdome
at Naseby Battel.” It is certain, however,
that a deputation brought it to Ottery, and
“tyed it in a blue Ribband and put it about
his neck.”</p>

<p class="caption">SIDMOUTH.</p>

</div>

<p>Sidmouth is only five miles away from
Ottery, and lies so prettily between its two
headlands that it is worth seeing, though
the lanes that lead to it are hilly. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
quite an old place, really. Its prettiness,
however, does not at all depend upon its age,
but on the ruddy cliffs that bound the bay,
and the little brown stream that runs down
through the shingle to the sea, and the tiny
cascade that glitters in the sun, and the
groups of boats that lie upon the beach.
Yet, driving through the western part of
the town, we see that Sidmouth after all
is merely a typical watering-place. Here
is the esplanade we know so well, and the
row of bathing-boxes, and the shrill-voiced
nursemaid with her shriller charge, and the
dreaded pierrot. Beyond that western end
rises the Peak Hill, and up its steep side
lies our way.</p>

<p>It is steep indeed; both steep and very
long. Before it is faced the hill-climbing
powers of the car should be carefully considered,
for the gradient at one point is at
least one in five, and is extremely steep for
a considerable distance. But from this height
the blue bay and red rocks of Sidmouth look
very lovely through the trees, and at the
top of the hill there are colours enough on
a sunny day to repay us for much climbing:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
pale blue hills and a dark blue sea, and a
wide expanse of varying greens, and to the
left a red cliff, and to the right, perhaps,
a patch of brilliant heather. Very carefully&mdash;for
the lanes are narrow and steep&mdash;we
run down the other side of the hill that
has just been laboriously climbed, and reach
the pretty street of Otterton, with its runnel
and little bridges, and thatched cottages,
and background of trees. We cross the
Otter, and are soon in East Budleigh, the
twisting, straggling village near which Sir
Walter Raleigh was born.</p>

<p>In the grey church on the knoll above
the street we may see the Raleigh arms, and
with them the three “horsemen’s rests” that
figure in so many shields&mdash;the arms of the
great Grenvilles. The bench-end that bears
them is the first on the left side of the aisle,
and was carved early in the sixteenth century,
when one of the Raleighs married Honor
Grenville. Sir Walter’s mother, we need not
doubt, sat in this pew many a time, for the
Raleighs lived only a mile away at Hayes
Barton. We can find the house quite easily,
standing beside a little sloping green: a low,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
gabled, grey house, with a thatched roof
and a gay old-fashioned garden. There have
been many changes here, of course, since
that sixteenth-century baby first blinked at
the world he was destined to explore; but
even then this was a humble home for the
daughter of the Champernownes, the mother
of two great men. For through this heavy
oaken door that swings slowly open to admit
us has passed not only Walter Raleigh in
his nurse’s arms, but also the Eton boy
who was his big half-brother, Humphrey
Gilbert. Of the life that was lived and the
ideals that were taught under the gables
of Hayes Barton we may perhaps guess
something, not over rashly, from the last
words of these two boys when they came
to die, each his tragic death. “This,” said
Sir Walter with a smile as he felt the axe,
“is a sharp medicine that will cure all
diseases.” “We are so near Heaven at sea
as on land,” said Sir Humphrey as his
last storm broke over him.</p>

<p>That Sir Walter loved this house, of
which his father was only a tenant, we
have good evidence; for when he was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
man he tried in vain to buy it. Here, in
the room on the left side of the doorway,
is a copy of the letter he wrote to Mr.
Duke. “I will most willingly give you
what so:ever in your conscience you shall
deeme it worthe.… You shall not find
mee an ill neighbore.… For the naturall
disposition I have to that place, being borne
in that howse, I had rather seat mysealf ther
than any wher else.”</p>

<p>The little room where he was born, the
room upstairs with the high ceiling and
the latticed windows, has not been changed,
they say. They say too&mdash;and for this one
was prepared&mdash;that he smoked his first pipe
in England in the room over the porch.
Sir Walter’s first pipe had evidently some
of the qualities of the widow’s cruse.
Wherever his name is heard the tradition
of the first pipe lingers. He smoked it, we
are told, on a rock in the Dart, and beside
a Devon fireplace, and in an Irish garden,
and here at Hayes.</p>

<p>And now, returning first to East Budleigh,
we go on our way to the Ever Faithful City
by lovely woods of fir and beech, and wide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
heaths, and hills and dales of richest green,
with here a glimpse of sea and there a
wealth of heather. Through Woodbury we
go; and Clyst St. George, where the Champernownes
lived; and Bishop’s Clyst, which
was once Clyst Sachvill. The last of the
Champernownes of Clyst was the unconventional
Elizabeth, who married her first
husband three days after her father’s death,
and her second husband two days after her
first husband’s death. “A frolic lady,” says
John Prince. As for the Clyst that once
belonged to the Sachvills and afterwards to
the bishops, it changed hands in this manner.
Sir Ralph Sachvill, being about to go to
France in the service of Edward I., was in
sore need of a large sum of money, and
mortgaged the manor of Clyst to Bishop
Branscombe of Exeter. The bishop, prudent
man, forthwith built largely on the
land, and made so many improvements
that poor Sachvill, coming home from the
wars with empty pockets, could not redeem
his estate. So Clyst Sachvill became Clyst
Episcopi, and the Bishops of Exeter visited
it when they needed change of air. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
time came, however, when “as Brounscomb
cuningly gott it, soe did Bishop Voisey
wastefully loose it.”</p>

<p>It was by this road that we are travelling
on, this very excellent road from Otterton,
that the Duke of Monmouth once came
riding into Exeter; and it was somewhere
near Bishop’s Clyst, I think, that a curious
spectacle met his eyes. Twenty thousand
people came out to welcome him, “but that
which was more remarkable,” says the
historian&mdash;and who will deny it?&mdash;“was
the appearance of a brave company of stout
young men, all clothed in linen waistcoats
and drawers, white and harmless, having
not so much as a stick in their hands.”
There were nine hundred or a thousand
of these innocents drawn up on a little hill.
The Duke reviewed them solemnly, riding
round each company. Then the stout and
harmless youths marched two by two, hand
in hand, before him into the city.</p>

<p>The story of Exeter has no beginning. To
Norman and Saxon, Roman and Celt, it was a
fortified stronghold, the Gate of the West.
For centuries it was the desire of kings, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
first thought of the invader, the forlorn hope
of the rebel. Yet, as we drive through the
dull suburb of Heavitree&mdash;which owes its
grim name to the gallows&mdash;and pass into the
heart of the town we see no sign of the walls
that endured so many sieges, the walls that
were built by Athelstane, that were attacked
by Alfred, that fell before the Conqueror, that
withstood Warbeck, that defended the cause
of Charles: no sign of the towered archway
that was once the entrance to Exeter and had
Henry VII.’s statue above it: nothing to
show us where poor Perkin, the king of straw,
battered in his futile way upon the gate,
“with casting of stones, heaving of iron
barres, and kindling of fire,” nor where
William the Conqueror, in ways that were
not futile, battered so successfully&mdash;“although
the citizens smally regarded him”&mdash;that it
was believed “some part of the walls miraculously
of his owne accord fell downe.” Nor is
there any sign of the western gate that once
stood at the further end of the High Street,
the gate through which another William,
seeking the same crown, came in a later
century. Through this street, which Leland<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
calls the fairest in Exeter, the great procession
of William of Orange swept in all its
splendour of bright armour and banners.
Here where we are driving they passed by:
the English gentlemen on Flanders steeds;
the two hundred blacks in embroidered fur-lined
caps with white feathers; the two
hundred men of Finland in bearskins and
black armour, with broad flaming swords,
very terrible to unaccustomed eyes; the motto
of the cause&mdash;“God and the Protestant Religion”&mdash;fluttering
on fifty banners borne by
fifty gentlemen; the led-horses and the pages
and the grooms; and the prince himself, all
glittering in armour upon his milk-white
palfry, surrounded by his running footmen
and followed by a mighty host. The billeting
of this host upon the citizens of Exeter, says
an eye-witness in a Letter to a Person of
Quality, “was done so much to the content
and satisfaction of the inhabitants, and such
just payments made for what the soldiers
had, and such civil behaviour among them,
without swearing and damning as is usual
among some armies, that it is admiration to
behold.”</p>

<p class="caption">GUILDHALL, EXETER.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>Of this brave show that meant so much
to England there is no relic left; but there is
still a memorial to be soon of another kingly
procession that once passed down this street.
Perkin Warbeck, after “mightily and tempestuously,”
but quite vainly, assaulting the
walls of Exeter, was pursued by Henry VII.
to Taunton, and “about midnight departed
in wonderful celerity” to the sanctuary of
Beaulieu. Then the King rode into Exeter in
state, and in his gratitude unbuckled the
sword that Perkin had not waited to see, and
took the beaver from his head, and gave both
sword and hat to the citizens in acknowledgment
of their “lusty hearts and manly
courage.” Here, in this old grey building that
projects across the pavement on our left, we
may see them still. In this fairest street of
Exeter there is nothing now so fair as the
Guildhall with the granite pillars and the
massive door of oak and the fluted panelling
of Tudor days. In the gallery above the great
hall are the two swords that won the crown
of England, so to speak: the simple sword of
Edward IV. and the splendid gilded one of
Henry VII.; and with them, cased in rich<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
embroidery, the black beaver hat in which
Henry gained his easy triumph over Perkin.
And among the pictures on the dark walls of
the hall itself are two that have a special
meaning in this place: Sir Peter Lely’s
portraits of the young Duchesse d’Orléans
and of the Duke of Albemarle. For it was in
Exeter, in a house that has now vanished,
that Charles I.’s daughter Henrietta was
born; and when the Articles of Surrender
were drawn up at Poltimore after the long
siege, there was special provision made for the
safety of the little princess; so that it was in
a “fit and convenient carriage” that she
started on that famous journey to Dover
which she ended, to her great annoyance, in
the disguise of a French peasant-boy. It was
in Exeter, too, that young George Monk
began his fighting career by thrashing the
under-sheriff of Devon. The exploit drove
him into the army, and when his talent for
fighting had made him Duke of Albemarle
the civic authorities let bygones be bygones,
and set up his portrait here. Perhaps they
recognised that the under-sheriff had richly
deserved his chastisement.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>Unfortunately the same Articles that provided
a convenient carriage for Princess
Henrietta also decreed the destruction of
Rougemont Castle, and there is nothing but
a tower and a gateway left of the stronghold
that Athelstane founded and William the
Conqueror rebuilt. Yet even in this fragment
there is one window, they say, of Saxon date,
one window that has looked out on all the
wild scenes that have been acted round the
Red Mount. Exactly how many sieges this
scrap of masonry has endured I do not know,
nor how many crowned heads it has helped
to shelter. William the Conqueror and
Stephen took possession of it in person;
Edward IV. and Richard III. visited it; and it
was probably here that Henry VII. stayed
when he came to Exeter at the time of the
Warbeck rebellion, to try “the chief stirrers
and misdoers.” “The commons of this shire
of Devon,” he wrote to the Mayor of Waterford,
“come daily before us in great multitudes
in their shirts, the foremost of them
having halters about their necks, and full
humbly with lamentable cries for our grace
and remission submit themselves unto us.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
In the same vivid letter he expresses a hope
that Perkin’s wife will soon come to Exeter,
“as she is in dole.” It is not from Henry
himself that we learn, however, that when
the poor lady actually arrived in this city he
“wondered at her beauty and her attractive
behaviour.”</p>

<p>When William of Orange rode into the
town with all his retinue of blacks and Finlanders
it was not to Rougemont that he
came, for Fairfax had nearly altogether destroyed
it. He slept at the deanery, and on the
following day entered the cathedral in state.
It has not altered since then. He saw the
stately Norman towers as we see them, and
like ourselves passed into the building through
the vaulted porch and rich mouldings of the
west doorway. Over his head was the
splendid tracery that is over ours, and on
each side of him were the clustered pillars
that we see. “And as he came all along the
body of the church the organs played very
sweetly, and the quire began to sing <cite>Te
Deum</cite>.” Whether that <cite>Te Deum</cite> rang quite
true upon the vaulted roof is open to doubt,
for the choir, apparently, sang it with much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
reluctance and left the church hurriedly
when their work was done, lest trouble
should come of it. Meantime the prince
sat down beneath the towering canopy of the
throne that the bishop had deserted, and
Burnet, standing at the foot of the pulpit,
read aloud the declaration that gave England
her liberties.</p>

<p>On the base of the throne are the painted
effigies of the four bishops who made Exeter
Cathedral what it now is: Warelwast, who
built the towers; Quivil, who designed the
Decorated building as it stands; Stapledon,
who set up this carved and pinnacled throne,
and the beautiful sedilia, and the “sylver
altare” that has vanished; and Grandison the
magnificent, who made the vaulted roof. Close
at hand on the north side of the choir, with a
restored canopy and a figure “very lively cut
in the same stone,” is the tomb where Stapledon’s
desecrated dust was laid. The enthroning
of this bishop, says Carew the chronicler,
was more than ordinarily splendid. Canons
and vicars-choral in their habits led him
to the throne, while “abundance of gentlemen
of place and quality” followed after.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
Very splendid, too, was his burial in this choir.
There had, however, been a burial of another
sort in London; for, having been made
Keeper of the City by Edward II., he was
attacked by the mob who took the part of
Queen Isabel. They dragged him from his
refuge in St. Paul’s, “and having grievously
beaten and wounded him, haled him along
the streets to the great cross in Cheap, where
those sons of the devil most barbarously
murdered him.” His headless body lay buried
in a sand-heap till the Queen ordered it to be
brought hither in great honour.</p>

</div>

<p>The “grave, wise, politic” Grandison, though
much addicted to pomp, was personally simpler
than the murdered bishop, who possessed
no fewer than ninety-one rings. Grandison’s
splendour was shown in hospitalities and
lavish gifts to his cathedral. It owes much
to him: among other things, I believe, the
minstrels’ gallery that we see above us on
our right as we walk down the nave&mdash;the
gallery that was built, they say, in order
that the Black Prince might be fittingly
welcomed with music when he visited his
duchy. The west front is Grandison’s, too.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
He once defended it and the dignity of his
office with a body of armed men, on an
occasion when the Archbishop of Canterbury
came on a visitation. Here at the west door
the angry prelates faced each other. Grandison
won the day, and the archbishop, says
Fuller, died of a broken heart.</p>

<p>It was possibly owing to the presence of
Fairfax, who reverenced all that was ancient
and beautiful, that the soldiers of the Parliament
did so little harm to the cathedral,
beyond destroying the cloisters. How much
else they destroyed in the close I do not
know: it is certain that much has vanished,
for in Leland’s day it had four gates, and
was “environid with many fair housis.”
There are still several fair houses in Cathedral
Yard that have survived the Civil War,
but not all of them have been admired
by Leland. He did not see, for instance,
the curious outline and picturesque bow-windows
of “Mol’s Coffee House,” nor the
panelled room that is emblazoned with the
shields of heroes and statesmen, of Talbot
and Somerset, of Cecil and Throgmorton, of
Drake and Raleigh and Gilbert. Tradition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
says that the bearers of these sounding names
were wont to discuss the affairs of the nation
in this room.</p>

<p>Before leaving Exeter we have a weighty
matter to settle: our choice of a road. There
are four ways of reaching Cornwall. Of
these the shortest is by Okehampton to
Launceston, and this has the advantage of
passing through the bewitching village of
Sticklepath: the best as regards surface is
by Ashburton and Ivybridge to Plymouth:
the most beautiful is the road that leads
across the Moor by Moretonhampstead and
Two Bridges to Tavistock: the most interesting
and varied is the long way round by
the coast, by Torquay and Dartmouth, Kingsbridge
and Modbury. In the matter of hills
the second of these roads is the least severe,
and therefore on the whole I advise those
who desire to reach Cornwall quickly to skirt
the Moor upon the south; passing through
Buckfastleigh, which has a new abbey on
an old site, and Dean Prior, where Herrick
lived so reluctantly, and Plympton, where
old Bishop Warelwast died. There is no
really steep gradient on this road, and though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
near Exeter there is a long climb followed by
a long descent, there are several surprising
miles, near Plymouth, that are almost level.
The surface is usually very good. The
scenery is not so strikingly beautiful as on
the other roads, but in places it is very lovely,
and everywhere there are the special charms
of Devonshire: the shadowing trees, the high
banks and trailing ivy, the stone walls green
with myriads of tiny ferns, the gardens full
of sunshine and flowers. Dean Prior, where
Herrick lived for many quiet years, singing in
sweet measures “how roses first came red
and lilies white,” and dreaming wistfully of
“golden Cheapside” and his Julia&mdash;and
others&mdash;seems at first sight an unlikely
place to be hated. Indeed, I think his hatred
of it and its inhabitants was merely a mood.
The same kind of mood that made him hurl
the manuscript of his sermon at his congregation
made him describe his neighbours as</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“A people currish, churlish as the seas,</div>
<div class="verse">And rude almost as rudest savages,”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">while all the time he was well aware that
Robert Herrick was ruder than either. There
were other days when he wrote very affectionately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
of his little house and his placid
life in this village where he has so long been
lying at rest. There is an ugly modern
monument to him in his church, but his
grave and that of his housekeeper Prue are
unmarked by any stone. The beautiful
epitaph he wrote himself will serve them
well:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse indent1">“Here’s the sunset of a tedious day:</div>
<div class="verse">These two asleep are; I’ll but be undressed,</div>
<div class="verse">And so to bed; pray, wish us all good rest.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Plympton through which this road
passes is not the birthplace of Sir Joshua
Reynolds, but has an interest of its own in
being the site of a monastery that was
founded by Warelwast, the bishop who
built the towers of Exeter Cathedral. When
he was very old he came hither to die. But
Plympton Earle is not a mile away; and
most of us will find time to drive into the
little town and pause for a moment by the
old house with the colonnade, wherein a little
boy used long ago to sit studying perspective
“with avidity and pleasure,” or copying his
sister’s sketches. Sir Joshua loved this place
where he first held a pencil, and in after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
years painted his own portrait for the town.
The town sold it.</p>

<p>This road, then, is not without its attractions.
Infinitely greater, however, are the
charms of the two other alternative ways
from Exeter to Cornwall&mdash;the one that
bisects Dartmoor and the one that skirts
the coast more or less closely. Those whose
object is a short tour in South Devon I would
advise to combine these two routes by driving
from Exeter across the Moor to Tavistock,
thence turning south to Plymouth on a
splendid road through beautiful scenery, and
returning to Exeter leisurely by way of
Dartmouth and Torquay.</p>

<p>The traveller who chooses to leave Exeter
by the Moretonhampstead road is likely to
feel that he has chosen well.</p>

<p>Like all these roads that run towards the
west it begins by crossing the river Exe, the
river that for three centuries was commercially
useless because two men quarrelled
about a pot of fish. In the market of Exeter&mdash;so
runs the story&mdash;three pots of fish were
waiting to be sold one day, more than five
hundred years ago. Upon this fish the retainer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
of the Earl of Devon cast an appreciative
eye at the very moment when the
servant of the Bishop of Exeter had determined
to buy it. In the fourteenth century
there could be but one result of this coincidence.
The matter, after a lively quarrel,
was laid before the mayor, and he, with
prudence that deserved to be more successful,
apportioned one pot to each customer
and the third to the market: whereupon the
Earl of Devon revenged himself upon the
corporation, against whom he already had
a grudge or two, “by stopping, filling, and
quirting the river with great trees, timber,
and stones, in such sort that no vessel or
vessels could passe or repasse;” and Topsham
became the port of Exeter. Now Topsham
was on the Earl of Devon’s land.</p>

<p>We go out of the town on a perfect surface,
and although, of the twelve miles between
Exeter and Moretonhampstead, there is only
one that is level and eleven that are steep
in varying degrees, the beauty that surrounds
us leaves us with no breath for
complaint. Whether we are climbing slowly
to the summit of a ridge, with valleys dipping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
deeply on each side and beyond the
valleys fold on fold of wooded hills, or gliding
down past Culver into the shade, or running
softly through a little green glen, there is
nothing but content in our hearts. Presently
we cross the Teign upon an old stone bridge.
Beneath us the river makes slow, soft music
on its mossy stones; on each side the hills
rise steeply; here and there a great red rock
pierces the green and purple of the slopes;
and as the road winds up the long hill
through the woods we are shadowed by
hazels and larches and birches, and the scarlet
tassels of the mountain-ash hang heavily
over our heads. When at last we finish the
long climb Moretonhampstead lies below
us. From this height it appears to be in a
hollow, but after running down a steep
hill for a mile and a half we find ourselves
unexpectedly looking up to it.</p>

<p>Moreton is the best centre, I think, from
which to see the Moor. Chagford is in a
lovelier position, hemmed about with hills,
and is larger and more ambitious, with
electricity to light its streets; but it is not
nearly so central as Moreton, which stands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
at the junction of four good roads. Gray’s
Hotel, though it makes no profession of
smartness, is comfortable and clean, and has
a capital new garage. The importance of
staying in this neighbourhood for a day or
two lies in the fact that there are several
lovely places within a radius of a few miles
which cannot easily be seen <i lang="fr">en route</i>. Of
course, those who prefer more stately
quarters can use Exeter as their centre very
comfortably.</p>

<p>It is not to us who move at various speeds
from place to place&mdash;by motor-car, or bicycle,
or train, or even on foot&mdash;that Dartmoor
will reveal itself. Do not let us deceive
ourselves. We may have driven on every
road and every tortuous lane between the
Teign and Tavistock, yet we need not dream
that we know the Moor. That knowledge
comes only with the slow years, only with
the passionate love that begins in childhood
and lasts for life.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;" id="illus11">

<img src="images/illus11.jpg" width="400" height="560" alt="" />

<p class="caption">LUSTLEIGH.</p>

</div>

<p>That is no reason why we should not see
as much of the Moor as we can, and love
it dearly in our own poor fashion. There
is much, very much of its beauty which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
who runs&mdash;and even he who motors&mdash;may
read. And the most beautiful part of it, I
think, is this eastern side.</p>

<p>Quite a short run from Moreton is to Bovey
Tracey, Hey Tor, and Manaton. We drive
out of the little town, as we drove into
it, past the seventeenth-century almshouses,
whose thatched roofs are supported on a
row of granite pillars, and whose features
are feebly reproduced on the opposite side
of the street&mdash;a case in which imitation is
very far from flattery. A narrow road
follows the course of the Bovey through its
pretty valley. At a point where road, rail,
and river nearly touch one another a little
by-way crosses a bridge to Lustleigh, which
has a great reputation for beauty, and
deserves it; for with its church and modern
cross, its thatched cottages, its stream and
little bridge, half hidden in their setting of
woods and orchards, it is a very lovable
village. Its spaces, however, are limited.
Drivers of large cars must turn near the
church under the elms, and see Lustleigh
on foot, for there is no turning place further
on, and the road beyond the village is impracticable.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
Its beauty is very alluring, but
its steepness is serious, and such is its narrowness
that even a car of moderate size brushes
the hedge on each side. It is far easier to
return to the main road, or rather the main
lane to Bovey, which has a good surface,
though it is narrow and winding.</p>

<p>The fine church that stands above the street
of Bovey Tracey was founded, it is said,
by the Tracy who was one of Becket’s
murderers, to atone for the deed by the
convenient method of the Middle Ages. But
all its splendour of carving and gilding, its
painted screen and pulpit, its porch with the
groined roof and grotesque bosses, are of a
later century than the twelfth.</p>

<p>There is nothing here to see except this
church and some restored stone crosses. For
no one knows, I believe, where the cavaliers
were quartered on that famous winter
evening when Cromwell rode into Bovey
with a band of horse and foot, and brought
dismay with him. “The Enemy in Bovey,”
says Joshua Sprigge, “were put to their
shifts, yet through the darkness … most
of the men escaped.” The shift the officers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
made was an ingenious one. They were
playing cards when Cromwell’s men marched
up to their door, and with admirable presence
of mind they flung the stakes out of the
window. By the time the soldiers had finished
picking up the money the royalists had escaped
by the back door, and were beyond
the river.</p>

<p>Almost as soon as we have crossed the
same river we find ourselves on the fringe
of the Moor, and begin to rise slowly on a
fine curving road, through a scene that
grows in beauty moment by moment. On
one side are the sweeping lines and satisfying
colours of the moorland, the heather and
the yellow grass, the greens and browns of
the bracken: on the other are all the graces
of a copse of birch-trees. At every turn the
view widens, till on the skyline Hey Tor
appears, very sharp and dark. As the road
sweeps round it the Moor is everywhere
about us, an endless series of rounded hills,
with the line of their curved shoulders
broken here and there by jagged tors. Everywhere
the rim of the landscape is blue
beyond all experience. When green has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
melted into grey, and grey has deepened
into an indigo so strong that it seems no
colour can be bluer, there is still beyond it
a line of hills as purely, piercingly blue as
the sky in June.</p>

<p>We run on between Saddle Tor and Rippon
Tor over hill and dale, till we look down
on the famous goal of a certain historic
grey mare&mdash;Widdecombe-in-the-Moor; then
past Hound Tor and round by the pretty
village-green of Manaton to the woods
through which the Becka’s waters dance
and sing. Here by the wayside the car
must wait a little time, while we are carried
to fairyland on a magic carpet of moss.
Long, long ago, say the fairies, this was a
stony, barren slope. Some wild spirit of the
storm had flung upon it a host of mighty
boulders, which lay there bare and grey
beneath the open sky. At last the fairies
came, and wove their wonderful carpet of
moss, soft and green, and laid it gently over
the great stones and over the earth, and
scattered their enchanted seeds upon the
ground so that the tall trees rose thickly
upon the hillside, and a mysterious, dusky<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
veil of leaves hid the river from the sky.
Then the fairies made their home here; and
we may walk with them through the woods
to that strange fall that in summer is no
waterfall, but a cascade of gigantic rounded
stones, flung from the height in a confused
mass, through which a thin stream trickles.</p>

<p>As we drive out of the dark and spellbound
wood we suddenly find ourselves on a
heathery hillside, all space and colour and
light; and by a winding road we return to
Bovey and Moretonhampstead.</p>

<p>Quite near to Moreton is one of those unforgettable
places of charm so rare that they
dwell in one’s mind for ever as types of
beauty. This is Fingle Bridge, which crosses
the Teign where the valley is narrow and
its sides are high and very steep, and the
brown river flows quickly among woods and
beds of fern, and a huge slope, completely
carpeted with heather, towers close at hand.
The best road is by Sandy Park, and beyond
that point even this is by no means good.
In Drewsteignton, indeed, a prudent owner
of any car that has more than a nine-foot
wheel-base will get out and walk, for between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
that delightful village and the Teign there
is an extremely steep and narrow lane, with
a surface that is chiefly made of stones both
large and loose. There is, moreover, no good
turning-place in the narrow gorge through
which the river runs.</p>

<p>A longer run than either of these is through
Bovey Tracey and Ashburton, and across the
Moor to Two Bridges by a road whose hills
are grimly described in the contour-book as
“all highly dangerous.” The description is
justified, and it cannot even be pleaded that
the surface is good; but the sweeping moorland,
and the woods that veil the hurrying
Dart near Charles Kingsley’s birthplace at
Holne, and the valley at Dartmeet, will compensate
for much. From Two Bridges the
road to Moreton is the same by which we
must cross the Moor on our way to Tavistock.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 590px;" id="illus12">

<img src="images/illus12.jpg" width="590" height="400" alt="" />

<p class="caption">HOLNE BRIDGE.</p>

</div>

<p>It is no hardship to travel twice upon this
road. The run from east to west, from Moreton
to Tavistock, is one to repeat as often as
may be, and to remember whenever life seems
dull. It is a glorious run. The road is hardly
ever level, of course, but the surface for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
most part is fairly good, and the hills, if
steep, are straight. And from our feet a wide
sea of fern rolls away on every side, billow
beyond billow, till its waves break at last
upon the rocks of a hundred tors. There
are certain scenes that remain with one, a
possession for ever. One of them is on the
hill where Grimspound lies. A little by-road
takes us quickly to the wild spot where
neolithic man built himself this dwelling,
with the object, doubtless, of keeping an eye
upon his neighbours rather than that of
enjoying the view. Whatever his motive he
chose well. He saw this splendid panorama&mdash;a
pageant of green and purple and indescribable
blue. One thing only he did not see:
the tragic thing that gleams so suddenly
and whitely in the far distance, when a sunbeam
chances to fall upon it&mdash;Dartmoor
Prison.</p>

<p>When we have passed the stony stream
and pack-horse bridge of Postbridge the
scenery is less interesting for a mile or two,
for this is the more civilised part of the
Moor&mdash;a fact that has a brighter side in a
comfortable luncheon at Two Bridges. Unless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
we change our minds and take the beautiful
road to Plymouth, we turn to the right here
after crossing the stream, and leave Princetown
and all its heavy hearts behind us on
the left. When the highest point of this
road is passed and the long descent begun,
the scenery is again of that well-wearing
kind that can be stored and put away for
the winter. And if I pay scant attention
to the vast host of most venerable relics
with which Dartmoor is dotted&mdash;I had almost
said <em>crowded</em>&mdash;this is not because neolithic
man seems to me a person of little account,
but because the study of his life and times
is not one that can be taken up suddenly
on a motor-tour. For one wayfarer who
takes heed of the menhir, and the stone-row,
and the pound near Merivale Bridge, there
will always be a hundred to gaze eagerly
from the hilltop at the long line of dark
and rugged tors that stretches across the
immense landscape, and at the gleaming
Hamoaze on the left, and at the clear outline
of Brent Tor Chapel on its rock, and
above all at blue Cornwall meeting the blue
sky. In the middle of this picture Tavistock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
lies, and we run down into it on a splendid
road.</p>

<p>The abbey that once gave renown to
Tavistock has nearly vanished, but even its
fragments&mdash;an archway and an ivy-covered
tower&mdash;are enough to bring beauty and distinction
into these pleasant streets. Ordgar,
the man who founded it, was the father of
Elfrida, the wicked Queen who gave her
stepson a stirrup-cup, and had him stabbed
while he was drinking it. It was in Tavistock
or near it that she spent her childhood,
and to Tavistock that Ethelwold was sent
by the King, to see if her beauty deserved
a crown. Ethelwold, seeing her, forgot all
else and married her himself. “She is in
noe wise for feature fitt for a king,” he
told King Edgar. Then the King, whom
men did not lightly deceive, came hither to
Tavistock to judge for himself, and Ethelwold
at bay told the truth to his wife, begging
her&mdash;poor ignorant man!&mdash;“to cloath herself
in such attire as might least set forth
her lustre.” Elfrida smiled; and when her
lord was gone arrayed herself in all she had
that was most rich and beautiful, so that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
“the sparkle of her fair look” made the
King mad for love of her. The next day he
took Ethelwold out upon the Moor to hunt,
and left him there with an arrow through
his heart; and after all Elfrida became a
queen.</p>

<p>The abbey her father founded was famous,
not only for its splendour, but also for its
learning. Though nearly all its stones are
gone there are still some of its documents
to be seen in the church, and certain ancient
books which were printed, I believe, in the
printing-press of these progressive monks.</p>

<p>It was in the year after the monks were
driven from their abbey that Francis Drake
was born to bring fresh glory to Tavistock.
At the end of a long, wide street his statue
stands&mdash;the familiar figure by Boehm, all
fire and energy, the “Francie Drake” we
know. His ardent face is turned towards
the town whose pride he must ever be;
behind him is the ivy-covered gateway of
Fitzford House. Through that embattled
archway Sir Richard Grenville&mdash;“Skellum
Grenville” as he was called&mdash;came home
with his bride to her own house; the house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
in which he afterwards shut her up, and
“excluded her from governing the affaires
within dore,” and even, it is reported, gave
her a black eye. This was the Richard
Grenville who was the King’s General in the
West, and was described by the Parliament
as “a villain and skellum.”<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> He raised an
army in Cornwall “with most extrem and
industrious cruelty” and brought it to this
place; and I believe it was here that young
Prince Charles stayed when he came to
Tavistock and complained so bitterly of
the weather. The soldiers of the Parliament
afterwards sacked the house, of which
nothing is now left but this gateway.</p>

<p>There may be some who have been led to
think that they have but to drive a few
miles from Tavistock to see the house that
belonged to the earlier, and far greater, Sir
Richard Grenville, the house of which an old
writer says: “The abbey scite and demesnes
was purchased by Sir Richard Grenvill,
whereon hee bwilt a fayre newe howse, and
afterward sold it unto Sir Francis Drake,
that famous travailer, wᶜʰ made it his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
dwellinge-plaice.” These I must sorrowfully
inform that Buckland Abbey is no longer
open to the public.</p>

<p>From the statue of that “famous travailer”
we turn to the right upon a fine road, and
presently, crossing the Tamar by a beautiful
bridge, climb into Cornwall on a gradient
of one in seven.</p>

<h3>III<br />
THE SOUTH COAST OF DEVON</h3>

<p>If our object in choosing to cross Devon
by the coast road were simply to cling
to the shore as closely as possible we should,
of course, drive to Torquay by way of
Dawlish and Teignmouth. But in that case
we should miss the beautiful views of Exeter
and the Moor from the slopes of Great
Haldon, and the gorse and pines on the
summit of Telegraph Hill, which most of
us will think more desirable things than the
beaches and lodging-houses of popular watering-places.
It is true that no esplanade nor
row of bathing-boxes can altogether spoil
a Devon sea. It is also true that the last
words of <cite>Endymion</cite> were written at Teignmouth;
but as Keats, being unfortunate in
the matter of weather, disliked the place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
very heartily, we shall be following in his
footsteps most truly if we are faithful to
“Nature’s holy face.” Her face is very
beautiful on the summit of Great Haldon.</p>

<p>We glide easily down the wooded slopes,
with the wild outline of Dartmoor against
the sky before us and the green valley of
the Teign below us, and after an almost
continuous descent of seven miles run into
the uninspiring streets of Newton Abbot.
Let us pause for a few minutes in Wolborough
Street, and picture the scene that
brought this little town for a moment into
English history: the throng of troops; the
crowding onlookers, half curious, half afraid;
in the midst of them the keen face of the
foreigner who had come to be their king;
the prince’s chaplain, here where the stone
is set, proclaiming William III.; and over
all the pouring, drenching rain. At the
outskirts of the town we may see the house
that sheltered William from the weather
that night, and has at various times sheltered
many incongruous guests of note&mdash;Charles I.
and “Steenie,” Oliver Cromwell and Fairfax.
William was at Ford House without a host,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
or the Courtenay who owned it at that time
doomed it wiser to be absent; but when
Charles I. was there Sir Richard Reynell’s
hospitality was such that a hundred turkeys
figured in a single <i lang="fr">menu</i>.</p>

<p>Only five or six miles of a comparatively
level road lie between Newton Abbot and
Torquay. The valley through which we drive
bears a familiar name, for it is in this Vale
of Aller that the well-known pottery is not
only made, but designed, in vast quantities.
I think it must have been along this road
that part, at least, of William’s wet and
motley army marched through the mud from
Brixham. As for the prince himself, his
course must have been truly erratic if he
slept at all the places in this neighbourhood
that claim to have sheltered him.</p>

<p>Torquay is one of those rare watering-places
that upset all one’s prejudices. Its
houses are many and modern, its streets are
populous; but the harbour under the hill
is so snug, the sea so blue and bright, the
boats so gay, the buildings so softly framed
in trees and flowers, that the most churlish
heart must be won. And near at hand the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
little sheltered coves, and wild paths above
the cliffs, and woods almost dipping into the
sea are quite as peaceful as though there were
no crowded little harbour on the other side
of the hill. This harbour was not here, nor
any town at all, when the Spanish Armada,
as Kingsley says, “ventured slowly past
Berry Head, with Elizabeth’s gallant pack of
Devon captains following fast in its wake.”
Only a few fishermen’s cottages were on the
shore, and the empty walls of William
Bruere’s abbey, and below the abbey “a peere
and socour for fisshar bootes.” Indeed, even
when the <i>Bellerophon</i> and the <i>Northumberland</i>
rode on the blue waters of this bay
together, and Napoleon sailed away to St.
Helena, there were more trees here than
houses.</p>

<p>To-day there are so many houses on this
shore that there is hardly a gap between
Torquay and Paignton. There is nothing to
keep us in Paignton, for though it has an
old church, and a tower that is called the
Bible Tower out of compliment to Miles
Coverdale, it has none of the charm of
Torquay. Only a few miles away, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
is a place of very definite charm. There is
a better way than this, certainly, of seeing
Totnes, but this hilly and not always very
good road has the advantage of passing near
the castle of Berry Pomeroy, one of the few
ruins in Devonshire.</p>

<p>The peculiar spell of Berry Pomeroy lies,
not in splendour of masonry nor grandeur
of outline, but in the silence and romance
of the deep woods in which the castle rock
is closely wrapped. From the old church
where Pomeroys and Seymours lie in their
graves we run down noiselessly through the
green shadows into a strange and dusky
world of legend and far-off history. Through
the towered gateway that fronts us generations
of Pomeroys have ridden forth to defend
or flout their various kings; and many
a Seymour, coming homeward by this path,
has lifted his proud eyes to the house his
fathers built within the Norman wall. For
when the last Pomeroy had “consumed his
estate and decayed his howse,” he sold it
to the Protector Somerset; and the Seymours
who came after him raised the dwelling
that is now a shell and was never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
altogether finished, though very magnificent,
according to John Prince, with curiously
carved freestone, and stately pillars of great
dimensions, and statues of alabaster, and
rooms “well adorned with mouldings,” and
a “chimney-piece of polished marble, curiously
engraven, of great cost and value.”
These splendid Seymours were descended
from the Protector’s eldest son. “I believe,”
said William III. to the last of them, “you
are of the Duke of Somerset’s family.” Sir
Edward bowed. “The Duke of Somerset,
sir,” he said, “is of my family.”</p>

<p>It was to this very gate, I believe, after
Henry de Pomeroy had taken up arms for
Prince John, that Cœur-de-Lion’s sergeant-at-arms
came on his sinister errand. Out
of the gate, however, he never rode. He
“received kind entertaynment for certaine
days together,” says the historian, “and at
his departure was gratified with a liberal
reward; in counterchange whereof he then,
and no sooner, revealing his long-concealed
errand, flatly arrested his hoaste … which
unexpected and ill-carryed message the gent
took in such despite as with his dagger he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
stabbed the messenger to the heart.” One
cannot honestly regret it.</p>

<p>This is the kind of place where legend
grows round history as naturally and quickly
as the ivy grows over the stones. The walls
themselves, it is easy to see, were raised
by a magician; for the castle, seen from
one side, is standing high upon a rock, while
from the other it seems to be deep in a
wooded valley. This is plainly due to a
spell, and prepares the mind for tales of
imprisoned ladies, and of wild horsemen leaping
desperately into the chasm when they
could no longer defend their castle from an
angry king. It is only on emerging from
the dim and haunted wood that one remembers
regretfully how the last of the Pomeroys
“decayed his howse”&mdash;so far was he from
defending it&mdash;and sold it quite peacefully to
the Duke of Somerset.</p>

<p>There was no very exciting rivalry, I
suppose, between the castle of Berry, even
at its best, and the castle that stands only
about two miles away on the “high rokky
hille” of Totnes; for the stronghold of
Judhael de Totnais and William de Braose,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
of Zouches and Edgecumbes, was the citadel
of a walled town. If we climb the rocky
hill in question&mdash;through the old east gate
of the town, and past the fifteenth-century
church and the hidden guildhall that was
once a priory&mdash;we may see for ourselves
how proudly the tower of Totnes once
dominated the valley of the Dart. There
is only a fragment of the keep standing
now, and even in Henry VIII.’s time “the
logginges of the castelle” were “clene in
ruine.” The story of their decline and fall
seems to be unknown, but I think the place
must have been treated with some indifference
by the Edgecumbes, who were, unless
I am mistaken, rebuilding their beautiful
house at Cothele when Totnes Castle came
to them. If this were the case we could
forgive them, and indeed be grateful for
their absorption in the lovely treasure-house
above the Tamar.</p>

<p>The various signs of age that make these
steep streets so attractive must not make
us forget that the antiquity claimed by
Totnes is a far more venerable affair than
any such thing of yesterday as a Norman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
castle. It was on a certain stone in Fore
Street that Brutus of Troy, father of all
Britons, first set his adventurous foot when
he discovered this island. So at least says
Geoffrey of Monmouth in his brave, imperturbable
way. Brutus, we must suppose,
sailed up the Dart; or perhaps at that early
date Totnes was on the coast. In any case
it was the charms of these woods and
waters that attracted the voyagers to land
in the new island, and “made Brutus and
his companions very desirous to fix their
habitation in it.” That is easily understood.</p>

<p>We too shall do well to come to Totnes
by water. It is the best way, and can be
done by steamer from Dartmouth. As this,
however, probably means the neglect of
Berry Pomeroy, which is far more serious
than the missing of Brixham, I advise every
motorist whose car can travel without him
to drive from Paignton to Totnes, and to
send the car by road to Dartmouth while
he himself goes thither by water. For the
banks of the winding Dart are, in their
gentle way, incomparable, with their soft
woods hanging over the stream, and their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
cornfields streaked with scarlet, and the
little creeks where thatched cottages are
clustered on the shore and white-sailed boats
flutter beside the tiny quay. And among the
trees of the left bank are Sandridge, the
birthplace of John Davis, and Greenway,
the home of the Gilberts, where Sir Humphrey
lived before his widowed mother
married Raleigh.</p>

<p>In the meantime those who drive their
own cars must return to Paignton by road,
and follow the railway to Brixham past
Goodrington sands, where Charles Kingsley
loved to spend the summer days searching
for the orange-mouthed Actinia and dreaming
of the Spanish Armada. There is not
a spot upon this Devon coast but is the
stuff that dreams are made of! Dreams
of gallantry and war, of conquest and
deliverance and wide adventure haunt us
hour by hour as we pass from haven to
haven, from Torquay to Brixham, and from
Brixham to Dartmouth, and from Dartmouth
to the climax of Plymouth Sound;
with the great names of Drake and Gilbert
and Hawkins, of Raleigh and Grenville<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
ringing in our hearts as we spin across
the soil that bred them, and, shining below
us, the green sea that carried them to
their renown.</p>

<p>The sea was not green, but grey and
misty, on the day that “the Protestant
wind” blew William the Deliverer into Torbay.
The fleet, says a letter written “on the
first day of this instant December, 1688,”
had met with “horrid storms,” but “was
not so damnified as was represented by
the vulgar.” It was here, in this harbour
of Brixham&mdash;now hemmed in by busy quays,
and crowded with trawlers whose flaming
sails might well be meant to commemorate
Orange William&mdash;it was here where the
statue stands that the prince first stepped
ashore. On his flag, as on the statue, was
the motto of his family: <cite>I will maintain</cite>.
The statue is not flattering&mdash;or so, at least,
we hope&mdash;but its presence, with its calm
promise of liberty, is not without dignity
amid all the bustle of the fishing-fleet. The
scene was busy enough that day, when
William stood here with Burnet, and the
guns roared, and the drums and hautboys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
made music, and from every headland and
housetop the people shouted their welcome;
and, as the fog lifted, the fleet, lying out
there beyond the breakwater, which was then
unbuilt, “was a sight would have ravished
the most curious eyes of Europe.”</p>

<p>William, and gradually all his regiments
of horse and foot, climbed these narrow
streets to the top of the hill. Though we
take another road than theirs we by no
means escape the climbing. Two slow miles,
on gradients varying from one in twelve to
one in ten, lead us to the point where we
immediately begin to descend, on a rough
steep road of sharp turns, which runs down
to the shore of Dartmouth Harbour and the
slip of Kingswear Ferry.</p>

<p>These are classic waters that lap upon
the clumsy sides of the ferry-boat. We
move slowly, and that is well, for there
is much to see: much beauty of wooded
headlands, of old streets drawing nearer,
of boats and ships upon a blue-green sea.
To the left are the two points that shelter
the harbour, and on each its ruined tower,
the guardians that did their work so long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
and well, and perished in the doing of it:
to the right the river winds away into the
land and the old <i>Britannia</i> lies at rest, and
the great buildings of the Naval College
crown the hill. It was from this harbour,
more than three hundred years ago, that
the <i>Sunshine</i> and <i>Moonshine</i> sailed away to the
North West Passage with John Davis and
his “company of goodlie seamen, not easily
turned from any good purpose;” and it
was between those two green headlands
that Francie Drake came home from “singeing
the King of Spain’s beard” at Cadiz, with
the <i>San Philip</i> and all her spoils behind
him. Historic fleets have ridden at anchor
in the shelter of these hills: ships for Cœur-de-Lion’s
crusade; and for Edward III.’s
siege of Calais no fewer than thirty-one,
all furnished by Dartmouth; and on one
grim occasion, at least, an unwelcome fleet
from France, which left the town a ruin.
Many years later another French ship came
sailing in unsuspiciously with letters from
the Queen, a few days after Dartmouth
Castle had surrendered to Fairfax. The
captain, when he heard the news, flung<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
the precious packet into the sea; “but God
provided a Wave,” says the historian, “to
bring it to the Boat that went out to
seek it, and so it was brought unto His
Excellency.”</p>

<p class="caption">BUTTERWALK, DARTMOUTH.</p>

</div>

<p>Round the quays on the Dartmouth side
of the harbour the queer old houses are
huddled into streets that climb and twist
and turn in bewildering irregularity. Crooked
gables and overhanging eaves nod at one
another across the way: the carved beams
and corbels of the wider streets rouse
memories of departed merchant princes:
rows of young trees are planted by the
waterside: and always, behind the trees,
behind the gables, is a glimpse of the turquoise
sea. Everywhere are signs of the
splendid past: in the fourteenth-century
church, with its magnificent screen and
pulpit, and the tomb of John Hawley, “a
riche marchant and noble warrior again the
French men”: in the houses of the Butterwalk,
with their heraldic beasts and granite
pillars and mullioned windows, their moulded
ceilings and carved chimney-pieces. It is
worth while to climb a rickety staircase,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
if only for the sake of hearing the Merry
Monarch numbered among the saints.</p>

<p>A narrow shady lane near the shore of
the harbour leads to the castle and the old
church of St. Petrock. The oldest part of
the fort, the round tower whence the chain
passed across the mouth of the harbour to
Kingswear Castle, is said to date from the
time of Henry VII. There must have been
some kind of fort here earlier than that,
I suppose, for when the lively men of Fowey
forfeited their chain of defence, we are told,
Edward IV. presented it to Dartmouth. This
castle changed hands twice during the Civil
War. Prince Maurice took it and strengthened
it, but could not save it from Fairfax.
“Being Master of all but the Castle,” wrote
the general, “I summoned that. The
Governour was willing to listen unto me.…
I can say I find it to be in the hearts
of all here, in all integrity to serve you.”</p>

<p>The road from Dartmouth to Slapton Sands
is almost entirely composed of astonishing
hills. Only in Devon could hills so many and
so fierce be compressed within so small a
space. But only in Devon, surely, is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
coast at the same time so wild and so
luxuriant, so stern and yet so tender; only
in Devon can we look down from the clifftop
through so soft a veil of trees, and see
far below us sands so yellow and rocks so
red, and the ripples of so very, very green
a sea. This road that rises steeply out of
Dartmouth is characteristically deep in the
shade of rocky banks, and walls built of thin
mossy stones. Long hart’s-tongues hang in
clusters by the wayside, and every cranny
of the walls is filled with tiny ferns. Having
climbed to Stoke Fleming by a variety of
steep gradients we promptly descend, by two
miles of gradients nearly as steep, to the
idyllic cove of Blackpool, whose golden sands
once flowed with the blood of four hundred
Frenchmen. They, and many more, had
landed here; but the men of Dartmouth,
who had not forgotten the sacking of their
town, came swarming down these cliffs upon
them, so that the survivors were glad to
put to sea again. Another steep climb takes
us up to Strete, and another steep descent
to Slapton Sands.</p>

<p>Here is a dramatically sudden contrast!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
From the very foot of the hill the road runs,
for two miles and more, over what is probably
the most level strip of land in Devon. It is
no more than a strip. Close beside it on the
left runs the long strip of the sands, and
close beside it on the right an equally long
strip of water, the reedy mere called Slapton
Ley. “There is but a barre of sand,” says
Leland, “betwixt the se and this poole. The
waite of the fresch water and rage of the
se brekith sumtime this sandy bank.” It is
along this bar of sand and shingle that our
road runs. If we turn away from it for a
few minutes, on the by-road that crosses the
pool near the hotel, we shall see Slapton
itself.</p>

<p class="caption">SLAPTON.</p>

</div>

<p>The village has no very striking beauty;
but its steep little streets, its thatch and
whitewash and flowers, its air of remoteness,
its maidens with their pretty blue pinners
and prettier faces, make it a very attractive
place. Nor is it without distinction. Not
only is it dignified by a thirteenth-century
spire of extreme austerity, but it also has
the remains of a collegiate chantry. The
chapel tower, with its graceful arch and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
fragment of groining, rises alone among the
flowers of a lovely garden, where wild olive
and camphor grow as serenely as the Devon
apples that hang above them. It is a private
garden, but as it skirts the road we may
drive almost into the shadow of the tower.
For several centuries, from the days of
Henry II. to those of Henry IV., this generous
soil belonged to a Guy de Brian. It was Joan
Pole, the wife of the Guy de Brian of Henry
III.’s time, who founded Pole Priory upon this
spot: we have it on the word of a Pole. The
later Brian who made it a college was one
of the original Knights of the Garter, and
a very versatile person, being Edward III.’s
standard-bearer in “that notable fight he had
with the French at Calais,” as well as an
ambassador and an admiral-of-the-fleet. In
the reign of Henry IV. this manor of
Slapton became the property of Harry
Hotspur’s crafty father; but to many of
us the most stirring memory in this place
is that of Sir Richard Hawkins, the third
great sailor of his name. He bought Pole
Priory&mdash;now corrupted into Poole&mdash;before
he set sail on that adventurous voyage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
that lasted so much longer than he expected.
During the ten years of his absence, years
of imprisonment in the South Seas and elsewhere,
this was the home of his “dearest
friend, his second self,” Judith, Lady Hawkins.
For some reason&mdash;whether to impress the
neighbours or because she suffered from
rheumatism I do not know&mdash;this lady was
in the habit of walking to church on three
quarters of a mile of red velvet carpet.
Possibly life was not very gay at Slapton
at the end of the sixteenth century, and
this mild ceremonial may have been a
comfort to her. The time came when she
sought another kind of consolation in her
loneliness. The story goes<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> that when Sir
Richard came home at last to Slapton he
found a strange air of festivity astir in
these precipitous streets. The red carpet
was laid, we may be sure, from Pole Priory
to the church, for when he asked what matter
was afoot he found it was his Judith’s wedding-day.
It was fortunate he came in time,
for one cannot quite see Richard Hawkins
in the part of Enoch Arden.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>The main road to Kingsbridge pursues its
level way between salt water and fresh till
it reaches Torcross, a most desolate-looking
village with a reputation for fishing. Here,
sad to say, we must turn inland. The scenery
between this point and Kingsbridge is no
great matter, but there are some pretty
villages, and Stokenham Church has a good
screen. The road is fair, and the hills less
formidable than usual.</p>

<p>There is no means of seeing, as a whole,
this beautiful coast between Torcross and
Plymouth, except on foot or from the sea;
but most happily it is possible for motorists
of inquisitive habits to find their way, here
and there, to various little havens of the
greatest charm. These, however, are all
beyond Kingsbridge. Kingsbridge itself is
a place of no particular attraction nor interest.
It has a few picturesque corners
and old houses, but its real claim on our
affections is that the only way to Salcombe
lies through it. Now a road that leads to
Salcombe is something to be grateful for.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 560px;" id="illus15">

<p class="caption">SOUTH POOL CREEK, SALCOMBE.</p>

</div>

<p>To those who do not know Salcombe, the
six miles that lie between it and Kingsbridge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
may be a little depressing. The road leads
to no other place, and is preposterously hilly:
the country is treeless and discouraging. To
the uninitiated it may well seem, as they
drive between the imprisoning hedges, that
no compensation is likely to be forthcoming.
But some of us know better. We reach the
edge of the hill, and suddenly the sea,
brilliant and soft&mdash;a sea of liquid jewels&mdash;is
shining below us, lapping upon the sands
of the little creeks; wooded slopes drop
steeply to the rocks that fringe the shore;
red and white sails flit about the harbour,
dapper yachts lie at anchor in the shelter
of the hill, wave-worn barges move heavily
towards the land; Salcombe lies at our feet,
clinging to the hillside, a tiny town of steep
streets and shipwrights’ yards and little
quays; and Bolt Head stretches out a long
arm to protect it.</p>

<p>There was an evening, not very many years
ago, when at the hour of twilight a yacht
put out to sea over the bar of Salcombe
Harbour, while the sound of the evening
bell came clearly across the water. Up the
estuary the lights were beginning to shine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
out one by one through the dusk, and in
the dark shadow of the headland the full
tide silently “turned again home.” Lord
Tennyson, who was on board the <i>Sunbeam</i>
that night, has made Salcombe Bar dear to
many who have never crossed it. He had
been staying at the pretty house that stands
on its own little promontory, hidden by trees,
between the town and the bar. Here for
some years lived Froude the historian among
the orange-trees and tamarisks, and it was
here he died.</p>

<p>This peaceful anchorage was very useful
to pirates in the good old days. They hid
safely behind Bolt Head and, when any
unwary ship passed by, dashed out and
plundered her. Henry VIII., though not
above piracy himself, built a little castle for
their undoing, upon a small precarious rock
nearly circled by the sea. Here are its
fragments still. Sir Edmund Fortescue
strengthened it and called it Fort Charles,
and held it very valiantly for Charles I.:
so valiantly that it withstood Fairfax, and
when it surrendered at last Fortescue was
allowed to take the key with him.</p>

<p>To nearly every motorist, as he sits beside
his tea-cup on the terrace of the Marine
Hotel, or leans against the wall that keeps
the sea out of the garden, it will occur at
once that this harbour is an ideal place for
motor-boating. This is truer than he knows.
For these waters that ripple round the
garden-walls of Salcombe pass on their way
inland in various directions: up South Pool
Creek to the thatched farmstead that has its
feet nearly in the water at high tide; past
Goodshelter to the old mill at Waterhead,
and to Kingsbridge four miles away. And
beyond the bar are all the little coves and
bays of a lovely coast: Hope, where the high
rocks entrap the sunshine and keep out the
winds: Thurlestone, whose worldly ambitions
are greater and whose charms are less:
Bantham, between a curve of the Avon
estuary and the sea, where the breezes are
sweet with the scent of gorse, and worldly
ambition seems altogether dormant. Even
without a motor-boat we may see these little
bays, each at the end of its own little lane;
but only such motorists as are staying close
at hand will care to explore lanes so narrow
and winding and steep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>On our way back to Kingsbridge, however,
to take the road to Plymouth, we shall see
a narrow turn to the left, near West
Alvington, which is a perfectly practicable
means of cutting off a mile or two of dull
country and avoiding a bad hill in Kingsbridge.
As a whole the main road from this point
to Plymouth is one of the best in South
Devon, though there is a long and very steep
descent at Aveton Giffard that is not marked
on Bartholomew’s map, and a sharp rise in
Modbury that is considerably steeper than
the contour-book estimates. There is no very
striking beauty of a large sort, but a great
deal of the restful, wayside charm that makes
Devonshire so comforting. There is no need
to loiter on the road, for though it played
its part in the Civil War&mdash;and indeed possibly
on that account&mdash;there are few relics of its
history to be seen. The bridge that crosses
the sedges of the Avon at Aveton Giffard
was once important enough to have a fort
built on the hill for its defence; but none
the less it was taken by the extremely
irregular troops whose clubs and pickaxes
and saws were wielded here for the Parliament.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
Champernowne of Modbury was one
of the builders of the fort, and one of the
greatest sufferers from the “clubmen,” for his
house, which stood on the top of Modbury
Hill, was fortified and occupied by the
royalists. “This Party of ours wᶜʰ was
at Modbury,” wrote Sir Bevill Grenville to
his wife, “indur’d a cruell assault for 12
howers against many thousand men.” One
result of this cruel assault, which could have
but one end, is that only a very small
fragment of Court House is still standing.</p>

<p>We go on our way through Yealmpton
and Brixton, on a surface that gradually
becomes very rough, and cross the toll-bridge
into Plymouth.</p>

<p>This is a name that stirs the blood of
every true child of Britain. In the days
of Elizabeth’s great sailors it was from
Plymouth that Britannia ruled the waves.
And to-day there is no end to the interest
that this place holds for those who love the
navy and the sea as is the wont of Englishmen;
no end to the modern interests of port
and harbour, of dockyard and battleship, nor
to the crowding memories on Plymouth Hoe.</p>

<p class="caption">DRAKE’S ISLAND, FROM THE HOE.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>Here on the Hoe, with Drake’s statue
beside us, and his island below us, and behind
it those fair woods of Mount Edgecumbe on
which Medina Sidonia cast a covetous eye,
we are looking down at the channel through
which all the gallant adventurers of the
sixteenth century sailed out to their distant
goals. This statue is the symbol of them.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
“He was of stature low,” says John Prince of
Francis Drake, “but set and strong grown;
a very religious man towards God and his
houses, generally sparing churches wherever
he came; chaste in his life, just in his
dealings, true of his word, merciful to those
that were under him, and hating nothing so
much as idleness.” The words fit the statue
well. It was here where we are standing
that he and the other captains played their
memorable game of bowls, while the Armada
called Invincible swept nearer and nearer.
His ship and her half-fed crew lay down
there in the Sound, under the lee of the island
that has borne his name ever since that day,
and the flagship, further out, “danced lustily
as the gallantest dancer at Court.” Through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
that channel he and the rest sailed out into
the gale when their game was done, to do
their thorough work. Many times he had
sailed through it already on various quests of
war and adventure&mdash;and, it must be owned,
of pillage: and it was from this harbour,
afterwards, that he went on the voyage that
“was marred before it was begun, so great
preparations being too big for a cover,” the
voyage to Nombre de Dios Bay, where he lies
“dreaming all the time of Plymouth Hoe.”</p>

<p>Very long and very stirring is the visionary
pageant that rises before us here: the Black
Prince, triumphant, sailing in with his
prisoner, the King of France; poor Katherine
of Aragon, landing here in an outburst of
welcome; John Hawkins, setting forth on
those dubious but gallant undertakings that
the Queen called “private enterprise” and
Hawkins called “the Queen’s business.” His
son Sir Richard long remembered a scene
that took place when he was a boy, under
that green hill that faces us. A fleet of
Spaniards, bound for Flanders to fetch a new
bride for Philip II., dared to sail between the
island and the mainland “without vayling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
their top-sayles, or taking in of their flags;
which my father Sir John Hawkins perceiving,
commanded his gunner to shoot
at the flag of the admiral, that they might
thereby see their error.” They saw it quickly,
and the matter ended with feasting.</p>

<p>Sir Richard’s own ship, too, takes part in
the ghostly pageant, sailing close to the land
to bid goodbye, for many more years than he
suspected, to the throng that stood here on
the Hoe to do him honour. Amid blowing of
trumpets, and music of bands, and roaring of
guns he left the harbour, with his thoughts
full of the lady who took pleasure in red
carpets. And it was there, below us, that the
brave heart of Blake gave its last throb as
he entered English waters&mdash;the heart that is
buried, they say, in St. Andrew’s Church.</p>

<p>The long procession of adventurous ships
winds endlessly on, past the island, and out of
the harbour, and away into the world of the
past. The ships of Frobisher and Gilbert, of
Grenville and of Raleigh are there, and the
<i>Mayflower</i> with the Pilgrim Fathers, and the
ship of Captain Cook. And at the last I see
a little ship sail in alone, and on her deck<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
a disappointed, disillusioned woman; the
woman whom the French have never forgiven
because, when they broke her heart,
she omitted to repay them with smiles&mdash;the
daughter of Marie Antoinette. The Duchesse
d’Angoulême came hither from Bordeaux, in
exile for the second, but not for the last time,
with the marshals’ vows of fidelity and the
news of their joining Napoleon still ringing in
her ears together.</p>

<h3>IV<br />
SOUTH CORNWALL</h3>

<p>One approaches Cornwall diffidently: one
leaves it with a sense of profound
ignorance. There is no county, of course,
of which any true knowledge can be gained
in one visit, whether the visitor be a motorist,
or a bicyclist, or that very superior person
the pedestrian; but perhaps this is truer
of the Duchy than of any other part of
England. The knowledge of Cornwall is
a special study with many branches, familiar
only to Cornwall’s devoted sons. It is easy
to love her beautiful face at first sight, and
easy to learn the part of her history that
is also the history of England, but behind
and within these superficial things is the
vast hoard of her local legends and traditions,
and the bewildering story of her unnumbered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
saints. A slight knowledge of tin-mining,
too, were not amiss. One can only admit
ignorance, and drive on happily.</p>

<p>Those who elect to approach the coast of
Cornwall from Tavistock, through Callington
and Liskeard, will travel on a fine road,
which four times dips down to streams and
forthwith climbs up again. On so hilly a
road as this, one may depend on finding
beautiful scenery. After passing through
Liskeard the better road to take is the upper
one by Morval, as it is less rough than the
road that follows the Looe.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 560px;" id="illus18">

<img src="images/illus18.jpg" width="560" height="400" alt="" />

<p class="caption">LOOE RIVER.</p>

</div>

<p>On the whole, however, I think the most
satisfactory way to enter Cornwall is by
Plymouth and Torpoint Ferry. Indeed, I
would even suggest that those who have
crossed the Moor to Tavistock should choose
this route; for the road from Tavistock to
Plymouth is magnificent in itself, and overlooks
some of the finest views in Devon. And
moreover the park of Mount Edgecumbe<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
is but a little way from Torpoint. It is true
that beautiful Cothele is but a little way from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
the Callington road; but Cothele is not open
to the public, though by the kindness of Lord
Mount Edgecumbe its granite walls and
historic furniture may sometimes be seen.
But Mount Edgecumbe, says John Prince,
is “the most beauteous gentile seat in all
those western parts.” The commander-in-chief
of the Armada, looking at it from the sea,
“was so affected with the sight thereof”
that he determined to keep it for his share
“in the partage of this kingdom.” His taste
was better than his seamanship. The house
that stands in this lovely park was built
by the grandson of the builder of Cothele&mdash;a
gentleman, according to Carew, “in whom
mildness and stoutness, diffidence and wisdom,
deliberateness of undertaking and sufficiency
of effecting, made a more commendable than
blazing mixture of virtue.” However commendable,
he was less attractive, I think,
than his grandsire, whom deliberateness of
undertaking would not have saved when
he was pursued by his enemies among the
woods of Cothele. He pushed a large stone
into the Tamar, and flinging his cap after it,
hid among the trees. Richard III.’s messengers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
of death, hearing the splash and seeing the
floating cap, thought he was drowned and
went away. “He afterwards builded in the
place of his lurking a chapel.”</p>

<p>The road from Torpoint to Polbathick is
excellent, and where it winds round the
creeks of the Lynher estuary there are
woods on the river’s very verge, as is the
lovely custom beside these West Country
waters. Across the valley is St. German’s,
wherein are some of Cornwall’s most venerable
memories and the home of the famous
Eliot who died nobly in the Tower. At the
fork just beyond Polbathick it is advisable to
take the road to the right, for though it is
a good deal the longer it is also a good deal
the smoother, and avoids a pair of steep
hills at Hessenford. The direct road is quite
practicable, however, and those who choose
it may take the opportunity of running
down the wooded valley of the Seaton to
the shore. On the other hand, if we
go by the longer road we shall see more
of the Looe estuary, which is far more
beautiful.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 560px;" id="illus19">

<img src="images/illus19.jpg" width="560" height="400" alt="" />

<p class="caption">LOOE HARBOUR.</p>

</div>

<p>To it the Liskeard road runs suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
down; then turns and follows it very closely
to the sea. Even closer to the water is the
little railway, which clings to the bank
under the hanging trees, and at one point
actually goes on its adventurous way in
mid-stream. The water, gorgeous as a peacock’s
breast, flows evenly between thickly
wooded hills, and as the valley widens the
town appears at the end of it, climbing
its steep sides.</p>

<p>As one approaches a place that is a byword
for beauty there is always a lurking fear
of disappointment. But the fishing-towns of
Devon and Cornwall are so disarming, so
personal in their charm, that they never
disappoint. Indeed, the trouble is rather
that they win the heart too quickly. Each
one in turn appears the ideal spot in which
to settle for life. So is it here. As we cross
the bridge that joins East Looe to West,
and look down at the green timbers of
the little quays and at the countless boats,
or up at the many-coloured gardens above
the road; as we drive round the point, and
find the open sea rippling in upon a rocky
shore, it seems obvious that this, and no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
other, is the place to live in. The conviction
lasts until we reach Polperro.</p>

<p>This we cannot do by way of the wide road
that runs round Hannafore Point, for this
ends abruptly opposite Looe Island. We must
return to the bridge, and without crossing
it take the road that rises on the left. As we
mount the steep hill we see below us the
meeting of the two rivers and their two
wooded valleys, and behind us among the
trees the scattered houses of the town. At a
point about two miles from Looe we turn to
the left, and run down a long and winding
hill into a tiny green gorge, with steep sides
rising almost from the roadway. It ends in
the narrow street of Polperro. Here, at the
beginning of the street, is the stable-yard of
a little hotel, where standing-room may be
found for the car. Beyond this point it is
practically impossible for a large car to turn,
for the twisted alleys of this cramped and
cabined village are hardly more than paths,
and owing to their contortions on the hillside
are often broken by steps.</p>

<p class="caption">STREET OF POLPERRO.</p>

</div>

<p>Why anyone should want to turn I cannot
imagine; for this is certainly the place to live<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
in! We knew all about it, of course, before
we came here: a thousand artists have painted
it. Large numbers are painting it at this
moment; a group at every corner. Since there
are so many of them it is fortunate that
artists&mdash;even amateurs&mdash;are among the few
human beings who are not blots upon a landscape.
They may give us lovely pictures
of this place: of the headlands that clip the
huddled houses so closely between them; and
the stream that rushes under weed-grown
walls to the sea; and the landlocked harbour
with its crowd of little boats; and the cobbled
lanes and whitewashed cottages and flights of
footworn steps; and the flowers that brighten
every narrow alley; and, best of all, the outer
haven with its warm red rocks, and white sails
reflected in the sea, and the stately outspread
wings of innumerable gulls. Yet none but
a magic picture could give us the magic of
Polperro. For no one could paint this sea but
a wizard whose medium was molten jewels,
and no one can feel the spell of the place
without the pathetic, haunting, insistent
sound of the seabirds’ cry. Indeed, it is this
sound that gives reality to Polperro. If it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
were not for this one might think it had been
designed and built for the use of artists. The
fisher-folk who live here could tell a different
tale; and the wild cry of the gulls reminds us
of a sea that is not always green and glassy.
Moreover, there was once a time, I believe,
when it seemed as though Polperro had been
designed and built for the use of smugglers.</p>

<p class="caption">POLPERRO.</p>

</div>

<p>Very reluctantly we climb out of the gorge
and take our way to Lostwithiel by Pelynt
and Lanreath, on a road of variable surface
and everlasting hills. In Pelynt church is
the restored crozier of Bishop Trelawny,
whose threatened death, as we all know,
determined twenty thousand Cornishmen
to “know the reason why.” There are various
monuments here too, some beautiful and
all interesting, of Trelawnys and Bullers;
and at Lanreath a lovely screen and a carved
wood cover to a Norman font, and on the
south wall a painted copy of Charles I.’s letter
of thanks to the men of Cornwall. From the
top of the first steep hill beyond Lanreath we
see the rounded outlines of Braddock Downs
before us, and at their feet the woods of
Boconnoc. Over those grassy hills the soldiers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
of the Parliament were pursued by the
royalists. “They were possest of a pretty
rising ground,” wrote Sir Bevill Grenville to
his wife upon the day of the fight, “… and
we planted ourselves upon such another
against them within muskett shott; and we
saluted each other with bulletts about two
hours or more.… We chast them diverse
miles … and we lost not a man. So I rest
yours ever.” A year later these slopes
were stained again&mdash;but not so darkly as
the royalist honour&mdash;when the infantry of
the Parliament, having surrendered, were
shot down as they passed the King’s army
unarmed, and were robbed of clothes and
horses. The King himself at that time was
staying at Lord Mohun’s place down there
among the trees. We pass one of the gates
presently, and skirt the park where Bevill
Grenville’s men, “upon my lord Mohun’s
kind motion,” were quartered by good fires
under the hedge.</p>

<p>This park that we see over the fence has
been owned by Mortains and Courtenays,
Mohuns and Pitts. The last Lord Mohun
did not, I fancy, spend much of his time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
under these trees&mdash;preferring those of the
Mall and of Richmond Park. When, after
surviving three trials for murder, he died
at last in his famous duel with the Duke of
Hamilton, his widow sold Boconnoc to
Thomas Pitt for half the sum, it is said,
that he received from the Regent Orléans
for the Pitt Diamond. It was here that
the great Lord Chatham was born.</p>

<p>We run down a long hill into Lostwithiel.
This is a place that has seen better days; for
Henry III.’s brother, the Earl of Cornwall
and King of the Romans, made it his headquarters
in the rare moments when he was
not trying to make up the quarrels of others
nor fighting in his own, and even in the sixteenth
century it was the “shyre towne.”
Of the “ruines of auncyent buyldinges” that
Leland saw there are only slight traces; but,
if we cross the pretty old bridge that spans
the Fowey and turn to the right at once, we
may see “the little rownd castel of Restormel.”
It is reached by a steep lane, and
there is no turning-room at the top except in
a private field.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;" id="illus22">

<img src="images/illus22.jpg" width="400" height="590" alt="" />

<p class="caption">RESTORMEL CASTLE.</p>

</div>

<p>“Only there remaineth,” says Carew, “an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
utter defacement.” But indeed there is something
more. This straight avenue of pine-trees
with its carpet of turf, the double entrance
across the moat, the heavy, gloomy ivy,
give to Restormel that air of mystery and
romance that seizes the imagination. Like its
founder&mdash;the prince whose strange exotic
name haunts Cornwall far more persistently
than he ever did himself&mdash;like Richard, King
of the Romans, this castle was more warlike
than domestic. Only the “fair large
dungeon,” or keep, and the “onrofid” chapel
are left standing now on the mound that
overlooks the valley so commandingly. It is
a fine position; yet, though it was hastily
strengthened for the Parliament, Sir Richard
Grenville<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> took it for the King.</p>

<p>The road from Lostwithiel to Fowey is for
the most part winding and stony, and extremely
narrow. In places it is also very
steep; and the hedges are high and comparatively
uninteresting. But a road that
leads ultimately to Fowey is entitled to do as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
it pleases on the way. The last part of it is
quite good.</p>

<p>On a very steep hill we creep slowly into
“Troy Town.” We look out, over the sloping
streets and the roofs of the houses and the
church, at the blue harbour and the hill
beyond it and all the busy traffic of the
port. Over this hill, hundreds of years ago,
the men of Normandy crept into Fowey in
the night and fell to fighting in the streets,
with a whole century of wrongs to avenge&mdash;a
century of raids and robberies on the
part of the truculent Gallants of Fowey.
The spoils of French harbours had made
the townsmen here “unspeakably rich and
proud and mischievous.” So the Frenchmen
came to Fowey “without the Foymen’s
knowledge or notice,” and killed everyone
they met, and burnt the town. Thomas
Treffry&mdash;Hals calls him John&mdash;gathered
some of the “stoutest men” round him in
his new house of Place, and defended it;
while his wife Elizabeth, like a true help-meet,
mounted to the roof and poured
molten lead upon the besiegers, with excellent
effect. Place stands there still, below<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
us on the left; yet not the same that was
besieged, since the tall tower is plainly of
Victorian date, and the very beautiful bays
that appear above the wall are Tudor. It was
after this exciting experience that Thomas
Treffry&mdash;or John&mdash;“builded a right fair and
stronge embatelid towr in his house: and embateling
al the waulles of the house in a
maner made it a castelle: and onto this
day”&mdash;and unto this&mdash;“it is the glorie of the
town building in Faweye.”</p>

<p>If we stand close below the church tower,
and look carefully at the stones above us,
we shall see the familiar badge of the ragged
staff, the cognisance of the Kingmaker. The
Foyens, when Warwick allowed them to go on
with their piracies, naïvely put his badge upon
their new church in acknowledgment of his
kindness, and persevered in their filibustering
ways. Edward IV., however, subdued them
by a most unkingly trick. His first messenger
they returned to him shorn of his ears, “at
which affront the King was so distasted” that
he sent a body of men to Lostwithiel, the
shire town, ostensibly to enlist volunteers.
The Gallants, who never asked for anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
better than to fight the French, trooped to
Lostwithiel at the summons of their King.
They were all arrested; and the chain that
guarded their harbour was given to Dartmouth.
I believe there are two links of the
chain still to be seen at Menabilly, behind the
hill.</p>

<p>From the windows of the Fowey Hotel we
can see, at Polruan, one of the square grey
forts to which the ends of this chain were
fastened. The ruins of the other are opposite
to it. These valiant little forts have seen a
good deal of service, and defended their port
long after their chain was forfeited. There
was a Dutch ship that came to this harbour-mouth
one day in pursuit of an English fleet,
and defied the forts in the insolence of her
seventy guns&mdash;“to the great hurt,” says
Hals, “of the Dutch ship … and the no
small credit and reputation of Foy’s little
castles.”</p>

<p>Fowey’s fighting reputation has always
been great, since the day when she owned
“sixty tall ships” and sent forty-seven of
them to the siege of Calais. To see the
harbour that has done so much for England<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
we must loiter in a boat beside the jetties
and among the creeks; we must pass the
dripping walls of gardens, and the flights
of steps where the seaweed clings, and the
houses whose back-doors open on the water;
we must watch the lading of the ships with
china-clay&mdash;ships from Sweden and Russia
and France&mdash;and pause before the picture
that Bodinnick makes on the hillside. It was
to this hillside, says the story, that Sir Reynold
de Mohun came to fetch his hawk, when
it killed its quarry in the Fitzwilliams’ garden
up there at Hall. Walking in the garden
was the fair Elizabeth Fitzwilliam, and on
the moment he lost his heart to her, and as
she thought him “a very handsome personable
young gentleman,” they became the first
Mohuns of Hall. Whether they were really
introduced by the hawk is doubtful, but they
were certainly married&mdash;and that not merely
once but twice: for the bishop divorced them
against their will, and it was only by appealing
to the Pope that they won leave to live
happily ever after.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>Even if we cannot see all the bends and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
creeks of the river from Fowey to Lostwithiel,
we must at least take our boat
between the woods and slopes of Pont Pill,
where it is only at the water’s very edge
that the ferns and heather yield to rocks
and crimson weed. Landing at Pont, we
may climb the steep hillside to Lanteglos
Church among the orchards, and see the old
stone cross beside the porch, and the wonderful
bench-ends within, and the elaborately
painted shields that bear so many famous
arms. On this little lonely church, buried
among the trees, things of beauty have been
lavished, not only long ago but lately; carvings
both old and new, and magnificent
embroideries, and pavings of marble. There
is no other church like this, I think: none,
so small and simple and lonely, that has
been so generously treated.</p>

</div>

<p>Fowey town is a maze of little streets;
but when we have climbed out of them&mdash;with
heavier hearts than seems reasonable&mdash;we
drive away past the lodge of Menabilly
on a very fair road. It will add little to
the journey if we go round by Tywardraeth
and see the old church, and the tombstone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
of the prior whose monastery has so strangely
vanished. A few carved stones in the
churchyard are all that remains of the
priory that was founded by William de Mortain,
“a person of a malicious and arrogant
spirit from his childhood.” It was well
named Tywardraeth, the house on the sand,
for great was the fall thereof; but why it
has disappeared so utterly, and how, is
curiously obscure. Gilbert tells the story
of the last prior’s resignation&mdash;an edifying
tale. Thomas Cromwell wrote to him a
letter full of compliments, praising his virtues
as a man and a prior, and telling him
how deeply the King appreciated his services.
These had been so unremitting, added Cromwell,
that his Grace, being mindful of his
age, would allow him to resign his post. To
this Prior Collyns answered briskly that he
was most grateful for the King’s kind
thought, but as a matter of fact his health
was excellent. So my Lord Privy Seal tried
again. This time the astonished prior was
informed that “the savour of his sins, crimes,
and iniquities had ascended before the Lord,
and that unless he immediately relinquished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
an office he had most grossly abused a commission
would inquire into his misdeeds
and punish him accordingly.” This, Collyns
understood. Here is his gravestone in the
church, in the wall of the north transept;
a slab of slate with a cross incised on it.
Some old bench-ends have been made into
a pulpit, and others inserted in new seats
of pitch-pine; but these are not relics of the
priory.</p>

<p>Leaving St. Blazey on the right, we run
on through some lovely scenery to St. Austell,
where a church-tower of wonderful splendour
and richness rises from the dull streets
of stuccoed and slated houses. Our road to
Truro is wide and has an excellent surface,
but one hill succeeds another with exasperating
regularity and promptitude. The
scenery varies from dulness to beauty: the
villages seem, to eyes that have lately looked
upon those of Devon, a little uninteresting,
for we are in the land of the Celt. Thatched
cottages are rare, but in Probus there are
several of them clustered round the churchyard
very prettily. This tower of Probus
is the highest in Cornwall, and very rich in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
sculptured stones: within the building are
the granite pillars that are common to nearly
all Cornish churches, and a screen whose
Latin legend alludes to the two patron-saints
St. Probus and St. Grace.</p>

<p>It is only a little way beyond Probus that
we cross the head of the Falmouth estuary.
By the rushy banks of this calm stream a
little band of horsemen once settled weighty
matters; for it was here, at Tresilian Bridge,
that the royalist general, driven into a <i lang="fr">cul-de-sac</i>
by Fairfax, made his final surrender
by the mouth of his commissioners. They
met Ireton and Lambert at this spot, and
the end of their meeting was the disbandment
of the royal troops. The generals
of the Parliament rode back to Fairfax by
this road of ours, beside the banks of grass
and rushes, and the mud-flats and the woods,
and down the hill to Truro.</p>

<p>Except the cathedral there is little to see
in Truro, and even the cathedral lacks the
glamour of age, for, of the masonry, only
the south aisle is part of the old church of
St. Mary: the rest is new. The general effect
of the inside of the building is fine, if a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
little severe. There is, however, a very
gorgeous baptistery in the south transept,
whose coloured pavements and crimson font
are in rather startling contrast to the prevailing
austerity. The roof, I believe, came
from the old church, with a few of the monuments.
The tomb on which John Robarts
and his wife are lying in such obvious discomfort
must be the one, I think, that was
repaired in the eighteenth century by a
mason whose bill included these items: “To
putting one new foot to Mr. John Robarts,
mending the other, putting seven new
buttons to his coat, and a new string to
his breeches knees. To two new feet to his
wife Phillipa, and mending her eyes.”</p>

<p>Those of us who are intending presently
to drive through the country of the Grenvilles
may be glad, when they come to Stratton
and Kilkhampton, to have seen Kneller’s
picture of Anthony Payne. It is here in
Truro, on the staircase of the museum in
Pydar Street: a burly figure in scarlet, with
a face that tries to be fierce but cannot hide
its tenderness and humour. This is Sir
Bevill Grenville’s giant henchman, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
fought at his master’s side at Stratton and
Lansdowne, and taught the children to ride
and shoot.</p>

<p>A fine road leads from Truro to Falmouth,
through hilly but beautiful country; by pine-woods,
and distant views, and the green flats
of the estuary, and a valley full of trees.
Near pretty Perranarworthal we see, crossing
a little gorge upon our right, one of the
old wooden viaducts that have so nearly
disappeared. In Penryn we cling closely
to the estuary, following it to Falmouth
Harbour. A hundred years ago the main
road to Falmouth from London, as it passed
through Penryn, “ran up and then down
through streets so steep and narrow,” says a
writer of that time, “as to make the safe
passage of the mail-coach a wonder.” To-day,
however, Penryn is one of the few towns in
the West Country out of which we can drive
on level ground.</p>

<p>When Sir Walter Raleigh came to stay with
the Killigrews in their fine new house at
Arwenack, he suggested to his host that he
should make a town here, on the shore of this
splendid harbour. The Killigrews were men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
of action, and the town was built; to the
acute annoyance of Penryn, which petitioned
in vain against its upstart rival. We make
our slow way through the narrow, crowded
streets of the Killigrews’ town, and find the
last remaining fragment of their house still
“standing on the brimme within Falemuth
Haven.” Only a crumbling wall is there, and
a window, and on the hill the avenue by
which the vanished Killigrews went in and
out; nothing to show that Arwenack was the
very source of Falmouth’s existence and the
very core of her history. For with every
concern of Smith-ike and Pen-y-cwm-wick
and Falmouth a Killigrew was connected,
from the day when they settled here in the
fourteenth century till the day when the last
of the name set up this pyramid that is beside
us&mdash;not with the justifiable object of honouring
the Killigrews, but for the astonishing
reason that he thought it beautiful. He
called it a darling thing. “Hoping it may
remain,” he wrote, “a beautiful Imbellishment
to the Harbour, Long, Long, after my
desireing to be forgott.”<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p class="caption">ARWENACK AVENUE, FALMOUTH.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>No Killigrew is likely to be forgot. It was
a Killigrew who gave the land on which
Henry VIII.’s castle of Pendennis still stands
out there upon the point; a Killigrew who
helped to build it and became its first
governor; a Killigrew who made Falmouth
and fostered it; and the eagle of the
Killigrews is borne to this day on the shield
of the town. The Killigrews are not forgotten.</p>

<p>It was the round tower of Pendennis that
brought Arwenack low. It is used as barracks
now, and to see the old building we must
have an order; but from the pretty shaded
road that circles it we can see nearly all there
is to be seen with the bodily eye. Yet if we
pass through the grey stone gateway there
are other things that we may see, perhaps:
Henrietta Maria carried in upon her litter,
“the most worne and weak pitifull creature
in ye world,” seeking a boat to take her to
France; her son a year later coming on the
same errand: the Duke of Hamilton brought
hither “to prevent his doing further mischief,”
by order of the King for whom he
lost his head a little later: Fairfax’s messenger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
summoning Sir John Arundel to
surrender his castle. “Having taken less
than two minutes’ resolution,” answered old
John-for-the-King, “I resolve that I will here
bury myself before I deliver up this castle to
such as fight against his Majesty, and that
nothing you can threaten is formidable to me
in respect of the loss of loyalty and conscience.”<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
Five months the garrison held
out; and when at last the remnant of them
filed through the gate&mdash;a pathetic procession
of sick and starving men tottering out with
flying colours and beating drums&mdash;they left
no food behind them but one pickled horse.</p>

<p>The belief that the little room above the
gate was used by Henrietta Maria is probably
due to what might be called the law of local
tradition; the law that masonry attracts
picturesque associations in direct proportion
to its own picturesqueness, and in inverse
proportion to the quantity of building that
survives. If one room only of an old castle
remains, it is that room, according to local
tradition, that was the scene of every event
that ever took place in the castle. A gatehouse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
is an improbable shelter for a queen
in time of war. As for Prince Charles, there
was once a tiny room in which he was reputed
to have hidden. Here we have another
invariable rule. Charles II. never occupied
any place larger than a cupboard; and even
in a fortress garrisoned by royalists he systematically
“hid.” In this case even his
reputed hiding-place is gone, and the legend
has not as yet been transferred to the gatehouse;
but if we enter the fort itself beneath
the sculptured arms of Henry VIII., and
mount the long staircase to the leads, we
shall see below us on the shore the little
blockhouse from which he escaped to France.
On our left lies the crowded harbour with
St. Mawe’s beyond it, and the round grey
tower that was built at the same time as
Pendennis: on our right is the bay of Gyllyng
Vase, named William’s Grave in memory of
the prince who was drowned in the White
Ship. Headland stretches beyond headland;
and far away on the horizon the Manacles
show their cruel teeth.</p>

<p>During the siege John-for-the-King set fire
to Arwenack lest the Parliament-men should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
make a battery of it. It is a common saying
that the Killigrews, in their loyalty, put a
light to it themselves. But strangely enough
the owner at this time was “ye infamous
Lady Jane,” who had been divorced by Sir
John Killigrew but kept possession of his
house for her life&mdash;a curious state of things
that definitely settles the question of the
firing of Arwenack. It was this Lady Jane
who gave the famous chalice to the town
of Penryn, “when they received mee that was
in great miserie.” It was not this lady,
however&mdash;as is often said&mdash;but Dame Mary
of Elizabethan days, who boarded the Spanish
ship in a true Elizabethan spirit and took
her cargo home to Arwenack.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p class="caption">KING HARRY’S FERRY.</p>

</div>

<p>Although this harbour “ys a havyng very
notable and famose,” it lacks the charm of
Fowey and Dartmouth; and it is only in
the upper reaches that the Fal has the beauty
of the Dart. It is wisest to start from
Falmouth. The hills at first are low and
the estuary wide; but when Carrick Roads
have narrowed into King Harry’s Reach and
the river sweeps past us between the rolling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
woods, we remember Hawker singing of
his native Cornwall and “her streams that
march in music to the sea.” We take
our winding way past the ferry to which
King Harry never came, past many alluring
creeks, past Tregothnan&mdash;the home but not
the house of Admiral Boscawen&mdash;and round
the green banks of Woodbury, till we see
Truro’s white cathedral against the sky.</p>

<p>When we finally drive away from Falmouth
our most prudent course is to go out of the
town past the recreation-ground, and take
the road that leads to the Lizard by Constantine;
for though the longer road
by Helston is by far the better of the
two, there are dark whispers heard in this
neighbourhood, sometimes, of measured distances
and other perils. We see on the left
the by-road to Penjerrick, where Caroline
Fox wrote her delightful journal and charmed
so many men of mark; pass through Constantine,
a village of solid stone houses, and
thatch, and gardens, and run down into
Gweek. It was here that Hereward the
Wake twice rescued the Cornish princess
from unpleasant suitors. The high green<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
walls of oak and ash that Hereward saw
are further down the river, but this is the
head of the tide where King Alef’s palace
stood, and the champion of England slew
the giant, and where now a brisk trade is
carried on in bone-manure. Whatever may
be the truth about Hereward, the last fact
admits of no doubt.</p>

<p>The miles that lead to Lizard Town are
of the sort that one remembers ever after
with a thrill. It is rather a complex thrill,
with contributions from the past and from
the future and from the exhilarating present.
The Marconi towers, slim fingers pointing
skyward, are not without their influence on
our pulses, with their hints of future conquests,
and their message that the fairy-tale
of to-day is the science of to-morrow.
The road is broad and smooth and level,
and lies between low hedges, and has the
straightness that the motorist loves; beyond
the waving tamarisks a flat land of green
and purple stretches away to the horizon;
for the first time in many days the car speeds
over the plain at the pace she loves best;
and the sea-wind rushes to meet us with
its story of the Spanish Armada.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>We slow down at last in Lizard Town,
where the squalid little houses are smothered
in flowers fit for a palace, blazing draperies
of scarlet and rose&mdash;the climbing geraniums
that in Cornwall grow, not as a favour,
but because they enjoy it. Here it is perhaps
best to leave the car, though it is perfectly
possible to drive to the foot of the lighthouse,
where there is room to turn. The first lighthouse
that stood on this spot was built by
one of the Killigrews of Arwenack, to the
great displeasure of the people. He was robbing
them of God’s grace, they naïvely complained&mdash;meaning
the spoils of the wrecked.</p>

<p>Beyond the lighthouse are grassy slopes
where it is good to sit alone among the sea-pinks.
To right and left are long headlands
and curving bays; on every side are masses
of grey rock crowned with golden lichen;
and beyond them the sea comes laughing
from the South. And on a sudden we see
the mighty crescent of the Armada, seven
miles wide, sweep up the Channel to its
doom, with the smoke of many guns flying
before the gale, and with every man upon
his knees.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>It is a disappointment to learn that the
track to Kynance Cove is too sandy for
motors; but only a few miles further along
the coast is the cove of Mullion, which is
easily reached on quite a good road. Those
who know Kynance declare it is more attractive
than Mullion, but I think there must be
some mistake about this, because it is not
possible to be more attractive than Mullion.
From the tiny harbour with its two sheltering
piers a natural tunnel&mdash;passable only
when the tide is low&mdash;leads through the rock
to the sands of a little bay. Here the cliffs
are high and wild, and masses of black rock
rise sheer from the ripples of a blue-green
sea, and in the caves the “serpentine” stones
are red and green and pink and full of
sparkles, like the stones of Aladdin’s cave.
One can see at a glance that the superstition
about Kynance Cove is quite without foundation.</p>

<p>From Mullion village we may either return
to the Helston road at once, or drop down
into Poldhu Cove, close under the Marconi
towers. Hence we must climb on a good
surface the very steep hill to Cury; for Gunwalloe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
is a place to avoid, although much
treasure, they say, lies hidden under the
sands there, buried by long dead buccaneers.
It is an unfortunate circumstance that
the road is liable to be buried under the
sands too.</p>

<p>The fine, wide road to Helston passes
through dull country, but the little town
itself, with its steep hill and many trees,
must wear a brave air on every eighth of
May, when the townsfolk are “up as soon
as any day, O!” and dance off into the fields</p>

<p>This Furry Day has been corrupted into
Flora Day; but Gilbert derives it very
plausibly from <em>foray</em>, and declares that it
celebrates a defeat of the Saxons, who
attempted a raid on this coast. The original
ceremonial included a foray on the neighbours’
houses.</p>

<p>From Kenneggy Downs we may turn aside
on a very bad lane to see the curving sands
of Prah and the grey tower of Pengerswick,
the hiding-place, in Henry VIII.’s time, of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
certain homicidal Mr. Milliton. Some say
he built it, but this seems an improbably
risky thing to do. It is more likely that
he occupied his enforced leisure in painting
the elaborate pictures and moral verses that
are now defaced. Few travellers will turn
away from the fine high-road across
Kenneggy Downs to attempt the deciphering
of Mr. Milliton’s reflections; but it will
not delay us to remember that John Wesley,
exasperated by the “huge approbation and
absolute unconcern” of the people in these
parts, preached a sermon on the Downs,
with a rare touch of humour, on the resurrection
of the dry bones. In a few minutes
we run into Marazion, and from the top of
the hill first see, through a gap in the hedge,
“the great vision of the guarded Mount.”</p>

<p>In starting forth upon a tour in Cornwall
there are two things, I think, that one
especially sets out to see; and in looking
back it is the same two things that one
especially remembers to have seen. One
is Tintagel; but the spell of Tintagel is
largely a matter of the imagination. The
other is St. Michael’s Mount; and here,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
though the imagination has much to feed
upon in calmer moments, it is chiefly as a
delight to the eye that it appeals to one
in those first moments that are so far from
calm. Little we care for Edward the Confessor
and his monastery, or for any tale
of battle and conspiracy, or for any legend
of archangels, while the Mount shows as
a blur of blue upon the pale, hot sky and
in the mirror of the wet sands, and Penzance
is veiled in a cloud of gold-dust save for
the tall church-tower that rises from the
mist, and the hills beyond the bay melt one
into the other, and the rocks lie in a long
red line across the foreground with a streak
of piercing green at their feet. Yet it is
hard to choose a moment and a point of
view, and say, “This is the best.” At high
tide or at low, in sunshine or at dusk, from
near or far, from Marazion or from Newlyn,
or framed between the red stems of the
pines upon the hill, the Mount is always
stately, mysterious, strong&mdash;always the Mount
of the Archangel.</p>

<p class="caption">ST. MICHAEL’S MOUNT.</p>

</div>

<p>It is reached from Marazion by boat at
high-water, or on foot by the causeway<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
when the tide is low. From the little
harbour we climb, on a winding cobbled
path among the trees and hydrangeas, the
steep hill that so many have climbed on
sterner errands: Henry de la Pomeroi,
serving Prince John while the Lion was
still safely caged; Lord Oxford and his men,
disguised as pilgrims, entering the monastery
with the help of pious words and seizing
it with the swords they wore under their
habits; the angry adherents of the Old
Faith, charging up the hill with great
trusses of hay borne before them, “to
blench the defendants’ sight and deaden
their shot.” Unfortunately there have been
modern visitors nearly as turbulent as these;
for which reason there is not much that we
are allowed to see here to-day. We may
go into the chapel where the monks once
worshipped, and we may stand on the little
paved terrace and look out over the parapet
towards the shore, thinking of Lady
Katherine Gordon, who surely stood here
sometimes while her husband Perkin Warbeck
was on his mad adventure. What
were her thoughts of him as she stood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
here? Did she know him to be an impostor?
Did she think he was the King? Or did she
only dream, and dream again, of that quick
wooing up in Scotland by the boy of “visage
beautiful”? “Lady,” he had said, “… what
I am now you see, and there is no boasting
in distress; what I may be, I must put it to
the trial.… If you dare now adventure
on the adversity I swear to make you
partaker of the prosperity; yea, lay my
crown at your feet.” To which the lady
had made answer: “My Lord, … I think
you, for your gentleness and fair demeanour,
worthy of any creature or thing you could
desire.… Therefore, noble Sir, repair, I
say, to the master of the family.”</p>

<p>It was here at St. Michael’s Mount that
they found her, when Perkin’s little fight
was over and her own little bubble had burst.</p>

<p>A wide and level road takes us round the
bay into Penzance, and up the hill whence
Sir Humphry Davy looks down upon the
street where he was born, and past the spot&mdash;now
covered by the market-house&mdash;where
Sir Francis Godolphin once tried in vain
to make a stand against the Spaniards, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
on, beside the sea, to Newlyn. This is a
name that is known wherever pictures are
painted or beloved; and no wonder, for there
is nothing in this harbour that an artist
might not turn to good account. Here are
fishing-boats reflected in the ripples, and
piers hung with dripping seaweed, and lobster-creels
and nets upon the shore; and beyond
them is the high sea-wall with flowers in
every cranny, and the steep street curving
round the harbour, and the people whom
so many painters have taught us to know.
For all its charm and fame it has changed
little since the sixteenth century. It is still
a place with a business in life; still, as then,
mainly a “fischar towne,” with “a key for
shippes and bootes.”</p>

<p class="caption">NEWLYN HARBOUR.</p>

</div>

<p>Rejoining the main road to Land’s End,
we pass through some pretty but very hilly
country to Lower Hendra. Those who wish
to see the Logan Rock must turn to the
left here, and run down to the sea through
St. Buryan, and finally walk for some distance
across fields. Most people, I think,
will keep to the high-road; but lovers of
old churches will wish to turn aside to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
sanctuary of that “holy woman of Irelond,”
St. Buriana. From this high ground, where
the tall tower stands as a landmark visible
for many miles, King Athelstane saw the
distant Scilly Isles, and here he vowed to
build a college if he should return safely
after making the islands his own. This Perpendicular
building dates, of course, from a
far later century than his; but it was the
church of the college he founded, and there
were parts of the college itself still standing
in Cromwell’s day.</p>

<p>St. Buryan is only four miles from Land’s
End. They are rather dreary miles, by
undulating fields and stone walls and the
intensely melancholy little town of Sennan;
but they end, all the more dramatically for
their dulness, in the granite walls that
guard our utmost shore. There is no dulness
here.</p>

<p>Here there is no carpet of sea-pinks, nor
splash of flaming lichen as at the Lizard,
nor rocks fretted into fantastic shapes by
the sea; but an imperturbable front of iron,
an unyielding bulwark, a stern England
that rules the waves. This is a fitting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
climax to our coast. On each side of us
cliff curves beyond cliff, and headland
stretches beyond headland. To the right
are the blue waters of Whitesand Bay,
where Athelstane landed from the conquered
Scilly Isles and John from unconquered
Ireland, and far away Cape Cornwall
bounds the view. With swelling hearts we
stand on the cliff and look out over the
buried land of Lyonesse, and beyond the
Longships Lighthouse, to the wide seas on
which Drake and Raleigh sailed away to
the Spanish Main, and Rodney to victory,
and Grenville to the death that made him
deathless, and Blake to Teneriffe, and Nelson
to Trafalgar. The salt wind blows in across
those seas and sings in our ears:</p>

<h3>V<br />
NORTH CORNWALL</h3>

<p>“I believe I may venture to aver,” wrote
Tonkin of Cornwall two hundred years
ago, “that there are not any roads in the
whole kingdom worse kept than ours.” This
is not the case now. The main roads of
Cornwall are excellent, and are far better
kept than the average road of Somerset,
for instance. No doubt the quickest way
from Sennan to St. Ives is by Penzance and
St. Erth Station; for this road, which is in
the direct route from Land’s End to John
o’ Groat’s, leaves little to be desired. But
the more interesting way is through St. Just,
and Morvah, and Zennor. We cannot expect
so good a surface here, yet from Sennan
to Morvah, where the country is so much
disfigured by mines that we are glad to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
hurry, the road is capital; and it is only
as the scenery becomes beautiful that the
surface grows rough. There is a very steep
descent beyond St. Just, followed at once by
a climb of which the stiffest gradient is
about one in five and a half.</p>

<p>It is in St. Just that we pass&mdash;on our left
as we drive through the Bank Square&mdash;the
ancient amphitheatre known as the Plân-an-Guare.
Here, in the fifteenth and sixteenth
centuries, miracle-plays were acted
on the level space in the centre, while the
six tiers of seats that are replaced by the
grassy bank were crowded with country-folk
and miners. The plays were very popular,
says Carew, “for they have therein
devils and devices to delight as well the
eye as the ear.”</p>

<p>There are none of these bizarre attractions,
nor indeed anything else, to delight our
eyes till we have passed Morvah. But from
Morvah to St. Ives we have a lovely drive
through a country of hills and heather, of
bracken slopes and tors of granite&mdash;a little
pattern cut from Dartmoor. At Trereen
it will be well to leave the car and walk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
across several fields to Gurnard’s Head,
whence there is a fine view of the jagged
coast. The massive granite steps that here
serve the purpose of stiles are luxurious
beyond the dreams of laziness.</p>

<p>The last part of this road is bad, but the
wild green slopes remind us still of Dartmoor
till we run down the long, steep hill into
the town of St. Ives. This is quite as good
a centre as Penzance from which to see
the western end of Cornwall, for the
Tregenna Castle Hotel, with its park and
walled garden and its lovely outlook over
the sea, is one of the most charming in the
Duchy; and the place itself is unspoilt.
Indeed, these little fishing towns of Cornwall
seem to understand very well that their
face is their fortune, so to speak; that their
welfare depends, not on bandstands and esplanades,
but on the beauty of their harbours
and fishing boats and narrow streets. Here
at St. Ives are the simple charms of Newlyn
and the rest: the same little piers and
clustered masts, the same contorted streets
and the same artists.</p>

<p>It is well that Mr. Knill, when he set up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
his crooked pyramid, did not place it too
near the town. If we look back as we
drive away we shall see, upon the skyline,
the empty mausoleum of this unconventional
mayor, who built his own tomb and arranged
to be mourned with music and dancing at
its base, but omitted to be buried in it.
Some say he did not mean it for a tomb
at all, but for a landmark to smugglers.
This may be so, since at one time he certainly
indulged in privateering&mdash;an enterprise
into which, he explained, “he was
hurried by the force of circumstances.”
Perhaps the same explanation applies to
his burial in London.</p>

<img src="images/illus32.jpg" width="590" height="400" alt="" />

<p class="caption">ST. IVES.</p>

</div>

<p>We drive on through the pretty, straggling
village of Lelant to the port of Hayle.
The rich colouring of the harbour and river
here, the red and green flats, the brown and
yellow sands, the crooked posts reflected
in the water, and the flocks of gulls, are
the last pleasing sights that we shall see for
many miles; for the country through which
we have to pass cannot have been beautiful
in its best days, and is now made hideous
by pit-heads and chimneys. Camborne is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
big and ugly, with trams: Redruth is big
and ugly, without trams: there is no other
visible difference, nor any gap between them.
But the compensation that motorists so often
find in dull country is ours: this is the
splendid highway that leads to John o’
Groat’s. We leave it when it turns towards
Truro, but by that time our surroundings
are less depressing. Above Zelah Hill we
take the road that crosses Newlyn Downs,
where the close carpet of heather somewhat
restores our spirits, though nowhere
till we reach Newquay is there any hint
of the beautiful things that lie hidden
in this neighbourhood. After crossing the
railway we should not take the first turn
to Newquay, but should wait for the second,
where the signpost stands. We shall thus
avoid two bad hills.</p>

<p>Newquay must have been a glorious place
before its shores were black with people, and
its steep red cliffs crowded with lodging-houses,
and its jutting promontory crowned
with a huge hotel. Even now, in spite of
these things, its wears something of a queenly
air. We have left behind us the slow ripples<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
of the southern sea: the fierce blue waves
sweep in upon this grand coast with quite
a different kind of dignity. But Newquay
is too world-ridden to be really lovable.
“How beautiful she must have been!” is a
sad saying, whether applied to town or
woman.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;" id="illus33">

<img src="images/illus33.jpg" width="400" height="560" alt="" />

<p class="caption">TRERICE.</p>

</div>

<p>In its neighbourhood, however, are several
noteworthy things. We have only a few
miles to drive, by leafy lanes and frequent
splashes, to a spot that the world has left
untouched and that time has only made
more beautiful, the house of the Arundels.
The best way to Trerice is the lane by
Kestle Mill. John Arundel of Trerice is a
proud name that becomes monotonous in
the annals of Cornwall, and is not unknown
in those of England. It was here they
lived, those warlike Arundels&mdash;old Jack of
Tilbury the Admiral, and John-for-the-King,
who made so gallant a fight at Pendennis.
Though the Arundels owned Trerice even
in Edward III.’s time, I do not think Old
Tilbury ever saw this Elizabethan building,
for he was an old man in the days of
Henry VIII. It was probably his son who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
built this lovely house at the foot of the
hill, with the huge mullioned window and
the moulded ceilings, and the oriel that
overlooks the walled garden and its yew
hedges. But John-for-the-King, we may
suppose, has warmed himself before these
splendid fireplaces, and has looked out
through these windows at the flowers and
pines, and has eaten his dinner at the great
oak table now in the drawing-room. Some say
he was a hard man. Possibly: for he lived in
hard times. Yet one who knew him well
called him “equally stout and kind.” “Of
his enemies,” says Carew, “he would take no
wrong nor on them any revenge. Those
who for many years waited in nearest place
about him learned to hate untruth.”</p>

<p>There was another branch of the family
who, for their greater possessions, were
known as “the great Arundels.” We may
see their house at St. Mawgan. When
approaching, from St. Columb Minor, the
deep wooded hollow in which Lanherne
stands close beside the church of St. Mawgan,
one should take the most easterly of the
two by-roads that lead to it. This hill, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
is true, is steep enough; but the other is
steeper&mdash;one in five. Those who are going on
to Bedruthan Steps or elsewhere will do
wisely to climb out of the hollow on this
same road, and go round by St. Columb
Major, for the hill on the further side of
St. Mawgan is the steepest of all!</p>

<p>Here in this seclusion, guarded by a triple
defence of hills as well as by the dark
woods and by their own high wall, live
the nuns of Lanherne in the house of
warriors. Not much of their dwelling is
visible, of course, but the chapel may be
seen, and one wing of the old house looks
down, with many mullioned windows, on
a gay little garden that all may enjoy.
Below Lanherne is the church, with turreted
tower and painted screen, and brasses and
bench-ends, and shields of the Arundels.</p>

<p>As I said before, the shortest way to
Bedruthan Steps is the longest way round&mdash;the
way, namely, by St. Columb Major. The
road by Mawgan Porth has an alluring look
upon the map, but as a matter of fact
comes to a sudden end in the sands; and
I have heard a tragic tale of a car that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
stuck fast there, and endured the humiliation
of being dragged out by horses. At
the junction of roads between the two
St. Columbs is a gate into the woods of
Lanherne, of whose loveliness this is the
only glimpse we may have, since motors
are not admitted to them. We turn to
the left in St. Columb Major, past the
grey church of St. Columba, a maiden
who was, says Hals, “comparatively starved
to death” in Gaul. Her church has had
a chequered career. One of the pinnacles
of the tower was again and again destroyed
by lightning and rebuilt in vain, till the
builders carved on it the words: “God bless
and preserve this work.” I do not know
if it escaped in the seventeenth century,
when three schoolboys, by setting fire to
some gunpowder, “made a direful concussion;”
but only a few years later the steeple
was again struck by lightning “and the
iron bars therein wreathed and wrested
asunder as threads.”</p>

<p>On a by-road that is of course hilly, but
by no means bad, we rise on to Denzell
Downs, with a wide view to the left and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
a glimpse of Mawgan Porth in the distance.
When, having left St. Eval on the right,
we come to an isolated cottage, we must
take the track that goes straight on; for
the one that turns to the right has an
endless number of gates, some steep hills,
and a very rough surface, and is much
the longer of the two. Even on the track
we take there are gates enough to try the
temper, but it soon leads to a field where
we may leave the car. We walk down
across the heather to the cliffs. These have
not the iron severity of the Land’s End:
the shale they are made of is friable, and
has been carved into a thousand shapes&mdash;including
a ridiculously life-like figure of
Queen Bess&mdash;by the waves that fret and
foam even on the stillest day. The wide
bay lies below us with all its decorative
arches and pinnacles and turrets, bounded
by Park Head, long and grey; and in the
distance Trevose Head makes the skyline.
Two flights of steps are cut in the cliffs:
one leading to the shore and the other
to a cave.</p>

<p>And now, after all this pottering in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
narrow lanes about Newquay, there are many
who will be craving for a comfortable run
on an open road. These I advise to join the
Truro and Bodmin road near St. Columb
Road Station, and drive over a series of
breezy heaths, on a good surface with no
serious hills, to Bodmin: thence to follow
the Fowey to Liskeard and run up to Launceston:
and from Launceston to return to
Bodmin across the moors. This is a fine run
and a real refreshment.</p>

<p>There is no lack of history in Bodmin, the
“dwelling-place of monks,” the burial-place
of St. Petrock, once a cathedral city, and
more than once the headquarters of rebellion.
Yet, save the great church, there is
little here to see. Very near Bodmin, however,
though not on our direct road, there
is a place of wonderful beauty, Lanhydrock.
This park is rich in splendid trees, carpeted
with fern, irregular and wild and lovely
beyond the common lot of parks. As we
sweep round a curve the gatehouse comes in
view, with its arch and octagonal towers and
pinnacles; behind it is the stately house, the
mullioned windows and the battlements; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
between house and gateway, enclosed within
a parapeted wall, lies the formal garden, the
rows of tapering cypresses, and urns of
flowers, and blossoming yuccas. When Essex
stayed here with Lord Robarts, at the time
that Charles I. was at Boconnoc, the gatehouse
was not yet built; but he saw the
north wing of the house as it now stands.
After his desertion of his troops at Fowey,
Lanhydrock fell into royalist hands, and for
a short time was owned by Sir Richard
Grenville, “the Skellum.”</p>

<img src="images/illus34.jpg" width="590" height="400" alt="" />

<p class="caption">GATEHOUSE, LANHYDROCK.</p>

</div>

<p>We drive away by a magnificent double
avenue of beeches and sycamores, and through
a shady lane join the main road from Bodmin
to Liskeard. This narrow valley of the
Fowey is one of the loveliest strips of inland
scenery in Cornwall. On every side of us
are trees, close by the wayside, and hanging
overhead, and clothing the high hills; and
all the time, sometimes to left of us and
sometimes to right, the brown stream hurries
past us through the bracken. After we have
crossed it for the second time the valley
narrows and the woods close in, before we
finally run out into open country. Between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
Liskeard and Callington, as we have seen
before, there are some fine views, but the
hilly road is rather badly kept; and the same
may be said of the country beyond Callington,
which has the same variable scenery, and
the same wide but bumpy road. A long rise
takes us into Launceston through the square
tower of the south gate.</p>

<p>Age after age this hill has had a fortress
on it. First the Celt and then the Saxon
made a stronghold of it, and finally, when
William the Conqueror gave it to his half-brother,
Robert de Mortain, there arose the
Norman castle that was called Terrible. Of
its terror little is left now, for one of its
three defending walls is gone, and the ruined
keep is so unsteady that no one is allowed
to climb its stairs. Yet this tower among
the blazing geraniums has not altogether
lost its romance, as is the fate of most ruins
that stand in public gardens; and the Tudor
gateway of the outer ward, with its portcullis-groove
and prison-cell, is picturesque enough.
If we peer through these bars we shall see a
tiny cell with mossy floor and weed-grown
walls&mdash;the “noisesome den” that George Fox<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
the Quaker named <em>Doomsdale</em>, the prison in
which he lay for months. “The commune
gayle for all Cornwayle is yn this castel,” says
Leland; and many distinguished prisoners
have been here, though not all in this
dark dungeon. Among these was Skellum
Grenville, whose imprisonment had far-reaching
results; for the men of Cornwall, as in
the case of Trelawny, resolved “to know
the reason why.” This was not because they
liked him, but simply because he was a
Cornishman. And a very good reason too.</p>

<p>In spite of all its strength Castle Terrible
was several times taken in the Civil War.
Finally it was seized by Fairfax, and kept.
He came to Launceston at midnight, and
many of the enemy escaped “by the darknesse
of the night, and narrownesse and
steepnesse of the wayes.” Those who were
taken were amazed in the morning, when
they were brought before the general, and
“had twelve pence apeece given them, and
passes to goe to their homes.”</p>

<p>When the Skellum’s brother Sir Bevill was
here his troops were quartered in the church
that is a few minutes’ walk from the castle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
the church that is surely unique in its effect
of richness. For every one of its granite
stones bears a device, sacred or profane, and
round the base is a course of shields, with
letters carved upon them to form an inscription.
Over the south door are St. George
and the Dragon, and St. Martin and the
Beggar; and at the east end is a prostrate
figure of the Magdalen, at which, by a curious
disregard of a certain great saying, it is
considered lucky to throw stones. Within
the church is a sixteenth-century pulpit, a
Norman font, and a good deal of modern
carving. Of the priory that Bishop Warelwast
founded at Launceston hardly anything
remains, except the Norman arch that has
been set in the doorway of the “White
Hart.”</p>

<p>We have a fine drive back to Bodmin over
the moors, where the hills are many but the
road is good. There is no heather here, but
a great expanse of grass and waving fern,
and scattered stones, and slopes of gorse,
and now and then, impressive in its loneliness,
an ancient Celtic cross of granite by
the wayside. We enter Bodmin by an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
over-arching avenue, and pass out of it on
the Wadebridge road, at the back of the
asylum.</p>

<p>The short run to Wadebridge is through
a lovely country of woods and valleys and
rivers, on a road that is well-graded if hilly.
There is little obvious attraction in Wadebridge
itself, however, for at low tide the
river winds through mud-flats that are not
flat enough to be picturesque, and the famous
bridge&mdash;“the longest, strongest, and fairest
that the shire can muster”&mdash;is not as striking
in fact as it appears in pictures. Like
Bideford Bridge, it is said to be founded on
sacks of wool. Its founder was one Lovibond,
the vicar of this old church of Egloshayle
that we see beside the river. We do not
cross the bridge, but turn to the right on
the road to Camelford; and a few minutes
later pass near a British camp called Castle
Killibury or Kelly Round. We are entering
Arthur’s country&mdash;a land of shadowy
legend, a land that has been peopled for us
with a host of adorable, improbable figures,
a land of disillusionment, but none the less
of unconquerable romance. For this round<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
encampment by which we drive is thought
to be one of the few authentic relics of the
authentic Arthur, the Kelliwic of the Welsh
Triads, a stronghold and court of the British
prince who truly lived, and fought, and
died of a grievous wound&mdash;but not at Camelford.</p>

<p>We are on our way now to the spot that
was long believed, and is still believed by
many, to be the scene of his last battle:
Slaughter Bridge. We turn off to the left in
the outskirts of Camelford on rather a rough
road to Camelford Station, and there take
a narrow lane on the right which leads in
a moment to the little grey bridge with the
grim name. There is grim truth behind the
name, moreover, for if it was not here, but
in Scotland, that Arthur died, there has been
slaughter on a large scale on the rushy banks
of this brook that sings so gaily. Here, in
the ninth century, Britons and Saxons fought
and died by thousands, and no one knows
to-day who won the battle.</p>

<p>On the left is the old gateway of Worthyvale.
A little way within it is a wooden
shed, where we shall find a guide to show<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
us the ancient stone that does duty alternately
as Arthur’s grave and his resting-place
when he was wounded. Its age and
position and probable origin are sufficiently
romantic, for it is thought to be the tombstone
of some warrior who was slain in
the great battle. It lies now on level grass
below the rocky bank, with the stream close
beside it, and tree stems fringed with hart’s-tongues
leaning over it. The path that leads
to it is very steep and very slippery, and as
one struggles down it the little barefooted
guide prattles cheerfully of the ladies and
old gentlemen who have, from time to time,
fallen headlong into the stream.</p>

<p>From Slaughter Bridge a few miles, a few
lanes, a few hills bring us, with hearts&mdash;even
middle-aged hearts&mdash;beating a little faster
than usual, to the very citadel and stronghold
of that Land of Faery of which Arthur
is the King.</p>

<p>Who can tell wherein the enchantment of
Tintagel lies? Its crown of towers is gone;
its glory is departed. Only, on the summit
of the dark, steep island a few low walls,
a doorway, and a window remain of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
mediæval castle that seems to have no history.
Not a stone here speaks of Arthur. Yet it
is of Arthur only that we think.</p>

<p>And if there is no fragment here of the
castle where Arthur was born, neither have
we any visions of the Table Round, nor of
Guinevere and her ladies, nor of Launcelot,
nor Galahad; for the King’s court was not
here. Only La Beale Isoud we may see
sitting in her bower upon this rock, and
Tristram kneeling at her feet, and behind
him Mark with the uplifted sword. This
was the stronghold of the ancient Cornish
Earls; and if Arthur was born here it was
because his birth was the result of magic,
and not because Uther Pendragon had any
rights in this place. But since we are here
in a world of legend we may surely take
the legend of our choice. Let us forget the
ugly tale of Uther and Igerne, and remember
only how, after the thunders of the
storm upon this shore&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="verse">“There came a day as still as heaven, and then</div>

</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>There are the sands below us, the little
bay in the curve of the cliff, the transparent
sea that brought the mysterious King to his
kingdom.</p>

<p>And because all is mystery here, because
behind the veil there is so little that is
solid, so little that we know, it is not in
the sunshine of a summer day that Tintagel
has the most meaning. It is when the mists
are trailing on the sea, and the dark rock
is wrapped in a cloud as impenetrable as
the legends that shroud Arthur, and for a
moment a passing gleam lightens the fog
above our heads and shows the pale ghost
of a castle-wall uplifted against the sky&mdash;it
is then that Tintagel seems indeed to be
the heart of the world of dreams, the most
perfect symbol of the mingled mystery and
truth of the story of Arthur.</p>

<p>More than three hundred years ago Carew
gave his impressions of the island fortress.
“In passing thither,” he says, “you must
first descend with a dangerous declining, and
then make a worse ascent by a path as everywhere
narrow so in many places through
his stickleness occasioning, as through his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
steepness threatening, the ruin of your life
with the failing of your feet. At the top
two or three terrifying steps give you entrance
to the hill.” Those who suffer from
unsteady heads will feel this lively description
to be most accurate as regards the
island; but the castle on the mainland may
be reached by a path which, though narrow
and tortuous enough, does not occasion, nor
even threaten, the ruin of one’s life. And
from those crumbling twelfth-century walls
we may walk along the cliff to the little
grey church that has stood here, buffeted
by every wind of heaven, since the days of
the Saxons. Part of the Saxon masonry
is still here, and an old font green with
moss, and various ancient stones. What this
bleak cliff has to bear in the way of sea-winds
may be seen in the churchyard, where all
the tombstones&mdash;thin slabs of slate&mdash;are
strongly buttressed by masonry three times
as thick as themselves. In a corner is the
poetical grave of an Italian sailor drowned
on this shore: an ordinary ship’s life-buoy
nailed to a rough wooden cross.</p>

<p>We drive away through the pretty village<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
of Trevena, dip into the wooded and flowery
dell of Bossiney on a steep and rather rough
road, and soon run down into Boscastle
among the orchards. The narrow gorge,
where the village lies smothered in trees,
ends in a little landlocked harbour, and high
up on the hill to the left stands the church
of Forrabury&mdash;the church whose bells, says
the legend, are lying at the bottom of the
sea with the bones of the blasphemous
skipper who was bringing them to Boscastle.
R. S. Hawker tells the story in “The Silent
Tower of Bottreaux.” We cross the stream
and begin a very long climb. This hill has
a bad reputation; but its steepest gradient&mdash;one
in six&mdash;is quickly past, and above it there
is nothing very serious. After three miles
of climbing we find some fine wide views;
and as we drive between the high hedges
on the rough road to Bude, catch glimpses
of sea and headland on the left.</p>

<p>The charm of Bude, I imagine&mdash;and many
people find it very charming&mdash;lies more in
its surroundings than itself, more in the
splendid coast and rolling sea than in the
rather dull little town. The sands and boats<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
at the river-mouth are picturesque, and so
is the “cross-pool,” where Hawker in his
sealskin coat once masqueraded as a mermaid
(of a somewhat full habit), to the sad confusion
of the youth of Bude.</p>

<p>Far more attractive in itself is Stratton,
hard by, with the dark church-tower raised
above the street, and half its houses hidden
by the trees. In this church with the fine
roof and the granite pillars is buried, under
a black marble slab elaborately inlaid with
brasses, a Sir John Arundel of the sixteenth
century; the father, I believe, of John-for-the-King.
And in the north aisle, with no
stone to tell the tale of his brave and faithful
service, lies Anthony Payne, the tender-hearted
giant who taught little boys to fish,
and fought with the strength of ten by Bevill
Grenville’s side, and wrote a letter for which
alone, if for nothing else, he deserves an
epitaph. When Sir Bevill died at Lansdowne
Hill it was Anthony Payne who broke the
news to Lady Grenville. “You know, as
we all believe,” he wrote, “that his soul
was in heaven before his bones were cold.
He fell, as he did often tell us he wished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
to die, in the great Stewart cause, for his
country and his King. He delivered to me
his last commands, and with such tender
words for you and for his children as are
not to be set down with my poor pen, but
must come to your ears upon my heart’s
best breath. Master John, when I mounted
him upon his father’s horse, rode him into
the war like a young prince as he is.… I
am coming down with the mournfullest load
that ever a poor servant did bear, to bring
the great heart that is cold to Kilkhampton
vault. O! my lady, how shall I ever brook
your weeping face?”<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>Down in the street we may find the house
where this servant with the heart and tongue
of gold was born and died. It was once a
manor-house of the Grenvilles, but is now
the “Tree” Inn, and shows little sign of age.
Until lately there was a hole still in the
ceiling through which Anthony Payne’s huge
body was lowered after his death, since it
was impossible to bring it down the narrow
stairs; but now this room has been rebuilt.
Fixed in the outer wall of the inn, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
is a relic of the battle on Stamford Hill,
where “ye army of ye rebells … receiued
A signall ouerthrow by ye Valor of Sir
Bevill Granville and ye Cornish army,” and
where Anthony Payne was valiant as his
master. Once this stone was on the battle-field,
but the owner of the land was so
greatly harassed by sightseers that in his
rage he dug out the memorial and built
a house upon the spot!</p>

<p>Here, as we drive out of Stratton on a
fine curving road, is the green slope on our
left where the desperate battle of Stamford
Hill, and the landlord’s desperate act of self-defence,
took place. It was on that hilltop
that Sir Bevill’s valour won him a personal
letter from the King, the letter that was
found in his pocket when he was dead.
“Keep this safe,” he had written on it; for
the Grenvilles were “King’s men,” not perfunctorily
but passionately. It is but a few
miles, on rather a rough road, to Kilkhampton,
where Sir Bevill and most of his house
are buried.</p>

<p>Indeed, Kilkhampton Church is as it were
the shrine of the gallant Grenvilles, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
deserves that high honour. A shady avenue
leads from the modern lych-gate to the porch
that was built by a Grenville and the Norman
door through which so many Grenvilles have
passed to their prayers, and so many have
been carried to their graves: Roger, who
for his lavish table was called the Great
Housekeeper, and John the privateer, and
Richard the Marshal and poet,<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> and Sir
Bernard, son of the greatest of the Grenvilles
and father of Sir Bevill. Sir Richard
of the <i>Revenge</i>, as we all know, died “with
a joyful and quiet mynde” on a distant
sea, leaving behind him “an everlastynge
fame of a valyante and true soldier that
has done hys dutie as he was bounde to do.”<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
But Sir Bevill, thanks to Anthony Payne,
lies in the vault of Kilkhampton, and with
him is the wife who could not live long
without him, and the boy who rode into
the war like a young prince and became
as ardent a royalist as his father.</p>

<p>Everywhere we see the Grenville arms:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
the three strange objects that some call
“horsemen’s rests,” and some call rudders,
and some clarions. They are outside the
south-east door, and in the chancel, and on
one of the elaborately carved bench-ends,
and on the old granite font, and in much
magnificence of paint and gilding on the
south wall. And here on the same wall is the
ugly eighteenth-century monument to Sir
Bevill, with its long epitaph. “A brighter
courage and a gentler disposition were never
marryed together,” said Lord Clarendon.
A better memorial of his bright courage
than this thing of gilt and marble is the
well-worn helmet that hangs beside it; and
of his gentle disposition we have proof
enough in his own and his wife’s letters,
with their engaging mixture of romance
and domesticity. “Would God but grant
you were home,” writes Lady Grenville, “till
when my heart will never be quiett.” “The
Plaisters you sent, I trust in God, hath done
me much good.” “I pray you make haste
and come home.… I am and still will be
yours ever and only.… PS.&mdash;I pray you
let your Coate be well ayr’d and lye abroad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
awhile before you weare it. To my dearest
and best Frend Mr. Bevill Grenvile, these.”
“Beseeching God to encline yr heart to love
her who will in spite of the divill ever be
yrs immoveably.” “If you please to bestowe
a plaine black Gownd of any cheape Stufe
on me I will thanke you.”<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p class="caption">MORWENSTOW.</p>

</div>

<p>Not far from Kilkhampton is another
church that some of us may care to see,
though the long lane that leads to Morwenstow
is by no means one that has no
turning. Indeed, it would need some ingenuity
to find room for any more corners in
these narrow ways; but if progress is slow
the country is attractive and the sea is
before us, with flat-topped Lundy Island
in the distance. We come rather suddenly
on the church in its steep and narrow
valley, with the tower darkly outlined against
the blue sea, and a bold sweep of heather for
background: the remote romantic glen where
Morwenna the hermit had her cell near the
sea, and died with her eyes fixed upon her
native Wales: the glen of which Hawker
wrote: “Here within the ark we hear only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
the voices of animals and birds, and the
sound of many waters.”</p>

<p>He must have heard the voices of a good
many animals; for even when he went to
church he was followed by nine or ten cats,
they say, which wandered, while he was
preaching, about this beautiful building
with the Norman arches, and the chancel
with the marble floor. Here at the foot
of the pulpit is the grave of his wife, the
devoted wife who was older than his mother.
Morwenstow, in its utter loneliness, its wild
beauty, its deep, full colouring, needs nothing
to give it charm; but its name, probably,
would be known to few if it had not had,
for many years, a vicar whose eccentric,
poetical, heroic nature made his name and
his dwelling-place memorable. We can
forgive his errant cats to a man who wrote
verses so sonorous&mdash;and above all to a man
who fought the wreckers as Hawker fought
them here.<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> His dust is not in the church
he loved and cared for; but his epitaph
is on the lips of those who knew him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
“His door was always open to the poor,”
they say.</p>

<p>The twisted lanes take us back to the
main road, and on a splendid surface we
cross the border into Devon.</p>

<h3>VI<br />
NORTH DEVON</h3>

<p>After a few miles of brisk running
over the breezy heights of Welsford
Moor we return to the steep, winding,
narrow lanes that have grown so familiar,
and pass slowly down the long hill to the
woods of Clovelly. To the left is Clovelly
Court, where the Careys lived, and the
church where they were buried, and to
the right is the turn towards the entrance
of the Hobby Drive, and the garage where
the car must be left.</p>

<p class="caption">CLOVELLY.</p>

</div>

<p>There are two ways into the village. The
shortest way is by the path that drops
almost from our feet, as we stand by the
gate of the beautiful Drive that motorists
may not enter. Very soon this path that
winds down the face of the cliff merges<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
into the village street, the famous street
that we know so well, even if we have never
seen it. For that very reason, because it
is so well known, I would advise those who
are here for the first time to follow the
road to the left, and after a short walk
that is almost painful&mdash;so steep is the way
and so loose are the stones&mdash;to enter Clovelly
at the bottom of the hill, near the quay.
Here there is an unfamiliar and beautiful
picture for one’s first impression of the
loveliest village in England. Overhead are
the trees that clothe all this hillside in
sweeping draperies of green; the picture is
framed in stems and ivy-grown rocks;
clustered under the cliff are the irregular
roofs of a group of cottages; a large boat
is drawn up by the wayside; and towering
in the distance is the soft mass of
trees through which the Hobby Drive winds
unseen. Almost at once we reach the little
pier, and Clovelly, hanging between sky and
sea, is facing us.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;" id="illus39">

<img src="images/illus39.jpg" width="400" height="560" alt="" />

<p class="caption">STREET IN CLOVELLY.</p>

</div>

<p>For some of its beauty one is prepared.
The little white houses clambering up the
precipitous hillside, the long, winding street<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
of cobbled stairs, the curving pier with its nets
and poles and nights of steps, the jerseyed
fishermen and pretty Devon faces, the boats
that fill the harbour and the donkeys that
climb the street, are all things that one has
been taught to expect. But neither pen nor
brush can give, in a single picture as we have
it here, the extraordinary variety and brilliancy
of their setting: the clematis that
trails about the verandahs, the fuchsias and
hydrangeas, pink and blue, that guard the
doors, the crimson valerian that runs riot
on the walls, the brown cliffs and ruddy
rocks, the woods that roll from the skyline
to the shore, and at their feet the little
shining pools and many-coloured seaweed,
and beyond them the long curve of Bideford
Bay and the sea, unutterably blue.</p>

<p>“Now that you have seen Clovelly,” said
Kingsley to his wife, “you know what was
the inspiration of my life before I met
you.” Here on the little quay he heard his
father, the rector, many a time read prayers
for the fishermen before they put to sea;
and it was the sad teaching of Clovelly,
where he saw so many men work and so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
many women weep, that gave its pathos to
the song of the Three Fishers. When his
health was failing, it was the air of Clovelly
that he pined for. He came to lodgings at
the top of this winding street that we climb
so laboriously, “the narrow, paved cranny
of a street,” as he called it, and stayed
there happily for weeks.</p>

<p>It would be easy to be happy here for
weeks; but in the summer there is some difficulty
in finding shelter even for one night.
Fortunately Bideford is not far off, and when
we have made our way slowly back to the
high road there are only ten miles of a good
surface between us and a comfortable hotel.</p>

<p>To reach it we must cross the famous
bridge. This “very stately piece,” as an old
writer calls it, has played a very prominent
part in the history of the town. “A poore
preste” began it, we are told, being “animatid
so to do by a vision. Then al the cuntery
about sette their handes onto the performing
of it.” Sir Theobald Grenville, Lord of Bideford
and Kilkhampton, a young ruffler who
had lately been in trouble with the Church,
made common cause with the bishop who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
ordered his excommunication, and after being
duly absolved became “an especial furtherer”
of the work. Grandison’s contribution took
the form of indulgences; the rich gave their
lands and the poor gave their time; and so
the pride of Bideford arose on its foundation
of woolsacks, and to this day gives distinction
to a town that is otherwise rather in need of
it. For wherever it was possible old things
have been made new here. The old part of
the Royal Hotel, once the house of a merchant
prince, has been so carefully hidden that no
one would guess it was there: the splendid
panelling of the room where Kingsley wrote
much of “Westward Ho!” has been painted:
the church was rebuilt in the nineteenth
century: even the tombstones have been
tidied up and marshalled in rows round the
churchyard wall. Within the church a few
relics have survived: the Norman font, the
remains of two screens, and the canopied
altar-tomb of Sir Thomas Grenville, called the
Venerable, who fought against Richard III.
and was esquire of the body to Henry VII.
The tombstone of the Indian who was
brought home by the great Sir Richard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
seems to have been lost or obscured by the
redistribution of graves in the churchyard;
but there is a modern brass on the south
wall to Sir Richard himself, who lived here
when he was not upon the high seas.</p>

<p>This is the only memorial, in his birthplace,
to the greatest of the “men of Bideford in
Devon;” but Charles Kingsley has a full-length
statue at the end of the promenade.
Kingsley, I imagine, would have preferred
a different arrangement.</p>

<p>Two miles away to the west is Westward
Ho! We shall see it under the hill if we
drive out to Appledore, where the sands are
very yellow and the sea is very blue. We
shall also see a spot called Bloody Corner,
which is said to be the burial-place of the
scourge of Saxon England, Hubba the Dane,
the devastator of Yorkshire, the marauder
of our coasts, the rifler of monasteries. A
slab of slate has been fixed in the wall on
the right side of the road, and an inscription
engraved on it by someone who was a lover
of history, but no poet.</p>

<p>The shortest, but not the most direct way
to Barnstaple from Bideford is by the coast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
road, whence we see, across the brown and
yellow sands, the river-mouth from which
seven ships of Bideford sailed out to fight
the Armada. This road is level, but extremely
dusty in dry weather except near Barnstaple,
where it has a “prepared” surface. The
direct road over the hills is so steep in places
that its directness is merely nominal; but
here the scenery is lovely.</p>

<p>There is a third alternative: to drive up
the Torridge valley, cross over by Winkleigh
to the valley of the Taw, and follow that
river to Barnstaple. This is a course greatly
to be commended.</p>

<p>Especially on a hot afternoon this is one
of the most desirable runs in Devon. From
Bideford to Torrington the road is shaded
nearly continuously by high banks of trees
rising from the wayside: on the left the cool
stream winds beside us. Torrington, on
its abrupt hill above the river, must have
been a place of dignity when its castle dominated
the valley. Through these streets
where we are driving Fairfax chased the
royalists one night in the dark, after a long
resistance “with push of Pike and butt end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
of Musket”&mdash;chased them clean through the
town and out of it to the bridges. This
engagement, wrote the general, was “a
hotter service than any storme this Army
hath before been upon.” The royalists meantime
had bribed “a desperate villain” to
fire their store of powder in the church,
lest the army of the Parliament should
benefit by it; with the unexpected result
that when “the Lead, Stones, Timber, and
Ironwork of the Church were blowne up into
the Ayre” two hundred royalist prisoners
were blown up too. Hardly any of the
Parliament-men were injured, though Fairfax
himself had a narrow escape, and was obliged
to return to “Master Rolls his house” for
the night, “in regard the Quarter at Torrington
was inconvenient, the Windowes broken
in pieces, and the houses so shattered with
the great blast that they could not performe
a convenient shelter from the raine.” This
church on our right among the trees replaced
the one that was blown into the air
so completely that hardly a fragment of the
old building remains; and this street by
which we pass through the town is the one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
by which Fairfax rode back that night to
Master Rolls his house. He went straight on
to Stephenstone, but we turn away to the
right on the road that skirts the castle hill
and passes near the Waterloo obelisk.</p>

<p>We see little more of the Torridge; but
this splendid Exeter road takes us through
very lovely scenery; by woods, and beds of
fern, and level heaths, and fields of meadowsweet,
and rows of shady beeches, while
for the last time our view is bounded by
the beloved hills of Dartmoor. It is a
curiously lonely road: hardly a village,
and indeed for some miles hardly a cottage,
breaks the solitude. Between the two
valleys, as we pass through Winkleigh and
bear round to the left to cross the Taw,
the country is less beautiful and the surface
rougher; but after the sharp turn at
Morchard Road Station we have a splendid
run to Barnstaple.</p>

<p>This is the most level road in Devon.
This fact alone commends it to us, but there
are many other facts to make it memorable:
woods of oak, and larch, and mountain-ash,
and chestnut-trees, not only shadowing us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
but filling all the landscape: tall red fir-stems,
and ferns beside the road, and wildflowers
everywhere. All the way we follow
the railroad, swinging past station after
station, Eggesford and South Molton and
Portsmouth Arms and Umberleigh, while
the valley widens and narrows and opens
out again; and all the time the Taw is close
at hand, growing from a tiny stream between
low banks of red earth and grass to a strong
river rippling over the shingle, with trees
dipping into its sunny waters.</p>

<p>Somewhere in Bishop’s Tawton lies the
dust of the first Bishop of Devon. It was
here that the see was originally fixed; but
when the second bishop was murdered it
was thought wise to move to a more central
position at Crediton. Beyond the pretty
village the estuary widens, and we see
Barnstaple before us through the trees.</p>

<p class="caption">ON THE TAW.</p>

</div>

<p>Barnstaple, says Mr. Warner of the eighteenth
century, “is by far the most genteel
town in North Devon.” This is a very happy
word; though why a town whose history
includes the days of Athelstane, a town
that has had a castle and a priory and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
life by no moans dull, should be “genteel”
when all is said, is hard to understand. The
nice public gardens and open spaces, the air
of clean prosperity, and the colonnade with
the fluted pillars give it an eighteenth-century
air, at latest. Yet, if we look behind the
church with the crooked spire we shall find
the brown stone grammar-school where
Bishop Jewell and the poet Gay learnt their
lessons; and in the narrow street near the
Imperial Hotel are some almshouses whose
granite pillars and beautiful moulded gutters
date from 1627; and spanning the river is the
“right great and sumptuus bridge of stone”
that was “made long sins by a merchaunt
of London caullid Stamford.” Nothing is
left of the priory where Sir Theobald de
Grenville was excommunicated with bell,
book, and candle; nor of the castle that
belonged at various times to Judhael of
Totnes, and the Tracy who murdered Becket,
and Margaret Beaufort, mother of Henry
VII. Even at the beginning of the Civil
War it was “a place of small strength,” and
during the struggle it led a hard life. The
Colonel Basset who defended it while it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
in royalist hands figures among John Prince’s
Worthies. “This gentleman as to his stature
was somewhat short, but of an high crest
and noble mind. As to his religion he did
not boast great matters, but lived them …
he being as plain in his soul as he was in
his garb, which he resolved should be proud
of him rather than he of it.”</p>

<p>The road that crosses the hill between
Barnstaple and Ilfracombe leaves the town
by the suburb of Pilton, whose white houses
and gaily painted shutters and high walls
have rather a foreign air. There is a long
but well-graded hill before us, and a surface
that is not very good. Each flowery village
is followed by another as gay, and each green
valley leads into another as green, and still
we climb higher and higher till we come to
the heather. For a little time the scenery is
dull; then the road winds down a deep valley,
and we see Ilfracombe in a gorge below.</p>

<p>Ilfracombe, like everyone’s grandmother,
was lovely when it was young. That, however,
was some time ago, and at present its
charms are a matter of taste. That thousands
love its piers and pierrots is evident at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
a glance, but some of us can only look sadly
at its bluffs and sparkling sea, and long for
the days that are no more. The change must
have come very quickly, for only fifty years
ago George Eliot thought Ilfracombe the
loveliest sea place she ever saw, and found
Tenby tame and vulgar after it. “But it
would not do,” she adds, “for those who
can’t climb rocks and mount perpetual hills;
for the peculiarity of this country is that it is
all hill and no valley.”</p>

<p>There are hills, and valleys, too, in astonishing
numbers along this coast. The contour
of the road between Ilfracombe and Porlock
makes a sinister picture. But those thirty
miles include some of the finest scenery in
England; and by making them more than
thirty, one may avoid some of the worst
gradients without missing any of the beauty.</p>

<p>For the first few miles the road clings to
the brow of the cliff, twisting round curve
after curve, and mounting and falling and
mounting again. All the colours of the
rainbow are in the landscape. There are
headlands of every shade of purple and red,
foliage of every tint of green, shadows that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
are intensely blue, sands that are really
golden, and a sea of a colour that has no
name. We swing round a curve and see
the white houses of Combe Martin wedged
between the brown cliffs, and a few minutes
later we turn away from the sea and mount
the long village street. Combe Martin may
be defined as length without breadth; for
though it is a mile and a half long it is in no
place wider than two little houses. It has
contributed in its day to the honour of its
country, for Edward III. and Henry V., it is
said, made use of the silver-mines of Combe
Martin during their wars with France.
Elizabeth gave cups of the same silver to
her friends; but Charles I., though ingenious
in the art of extracting the precious metals,
sought here in vain.</p>

<p>The road, as it climbs up to Exmoor, grows
rather rough. From Blackmoor Gate the
direct way to Lynton is of course through
Parracombe, where there are two hills of
some renown, a descent and a climb. The
inconvenience here is in the fact that the
change from the downward to the upward
gradient is in the middle of the village, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
a run is out of the question. None the less
this hill, though steep, is quite practicable;
but the still more famous hill between
Lynton and Lynmouth thoroughly deserves
its reputation, and, after personal experience,
I strongly advise motorists to avoid it unless
they have absolute confidence in the staunchness
of their car, the power of their brakes,
and the scope of their steering-locks. Its
difficulty lies, not only in the gradient&mdash;though
at one point that is steeper than one in four&mdash;but
in the extremely acute angle that occurs
at the steepest spot and makes it impossible,
if there should chance to be so much as a
wheelbarrow by the wayside, for a car of any
size to turn without pausing. An added
difficulty is the looseness of the surface, for
the constant use of drags has ploughed the
road into a mass of stones and sand. It is
possible now to take cars on the “lift,” or
funicular railway that runs up and down
the cliff; but it seems to me that the simplest
plan is to drive round by Simonsbath to
Lynmouth. There is shelter there for both
man and car; but those who prefer to stay
at Lynton&mdash;and they are many&mdash;may leave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
their cars at the bottom of the hill, and
mount it themselves, with their luggage, in
the cliff railway.</p>

<p>At Blackmoor Gate, then, instead of taking
the road to Parracombe, we must go straight
on till we turn to the left at Challacombe.
The country is not inspiring. Technically,
I suppose, this is part of Exmoor; but there
is nothing in these undulating fields and
hedgerows to suggest the hunting of the
red deer by Saxon kings, or the jealous
guarding of forest-rights by the Conqueror.
For William, though he gave away these
lands, was very strict about the hunting. “He
loved the tall deer as though he had been
their father,” says the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle.
His love was like that of the little boy who
was so fond of animals that he always went
to see the pigs killed.</p>

<p class="caption">LYNMOUTH.</p>

</div>

<p>At Simonsbath there is a sudden outburst
of beauty. The tiny village lies in a hollow
among the fir-clad hills, and makes an idyllic
picture with its stream and bridge; and here
the road turns and winds up to a fine expanse
of true moorland. It is sterner than Dartmoor.
There is no luxuriance of bracken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
here, nor acres of purple, but mile beyond
grassy mile of stately, rolling hills, very
austere at noonday, but in the light of a
summer sunset transfigured into splendour.
The new road to Lynmouth turns abruptly
back upon the hillside, and on it we plunge
into the green depths.<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>If Nature is austere upon these hills, in
the valley she is riotous. We seem to be
dropping down and down into her generous
heart, and, like the poet, we bless ourselves
with silence. Far above us, as we wind
beside the river, the tall sides of the valley
are clear-cut against the sky; but just below
the line of rock and heather the rich woods
rise up and take triumphant possession of
the hills, and fill every curve and hollow,
and clothe the steep heights, and hang over
the stream, and rustle by the wayside. We
have dropped so suddenly and deeply into
these green waves that we almost expect
them to close over our heads. And as the
road winds on we think at every corner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
that all this beauty must come to a sudden
end. Surely we have passed the climax:
surely the next curve will take us out of this
enchanted valley into the world we know.
But the beauty does not end. It grows; and
only finds its climax in the red and green
headlands, and in the lovely village that lies
between the hills where the valley ends in
the sea.</p>

<p>Lynmouth below and Lynton above, when
one recalls them, seem, like Clovelly, too
good to be true. All the charms of Devon
are here. Charms that elsewhere seem
incongruous are here in accord; grandeur
and homeliness agree together; the lion lies
down with the lamb. Boats and heather are
in the same picture; the cliffs are clothed
with woods almost to the water’s edge. The
two places cannot be compared; they are so
different that neither is complete without the
other. Some love best the boats and shallow
pools and shaded river of Lynmouth; and to
some the wide view from Lynton hill seems
the fairest thing in England.</p>

<img src="images/illus43.jpg" width="560" height="400" alt="" />

<p class="caption">VIEW FROM LYNTON.</p>

</div>

<p>Wherever we stay ourselves, there is little
to be gained by taking the car up the cliff.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
The only roads that lead away from Lynton
are the Parracombe road and the road to
Hunter’s Inn, which is not open to motors&mdash;that
wonderful road that runs through the
wild Valley of Rocks, and past the Castle
Rock with its fine views of the coast, and
past Lee Abbey on its grassy plateau, and
then for miles along the face of the cliff,
with dense woods closing round it on every
side, and, through the trees, hints of a blue
sea very far below. This narrow way that is
hung so high in air, and has so many sharp
corners and steep pitches, is truly not a
motoring road. It turns inland where a gap
comes in the cliffs, and ends at Hunter’s
Inn, in a narrow gorge that is sheltered from
every wind.</p>

<p>From Lynton we look over the roofs of
Lynmouth to Countisbury Hill and the red
road that climbs it&mdash;apparently quite perpendicularly.
Into the mind there steals a hope
that this is not our road. But it is.</p>

<p>We may avoid it, of course, by going back
to Simonsbath and taking the road through
Exford and Whiddon Cross to Dunster&mdash;a
road that is fairly good, if dull. But most of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
us will think the loss of all the beauty of the
moors and woods is too heavy a price to pay
for ease of travelling. The lower part of
Countisbury Hill, it is true, is quite as rough
and nearly as precipitous as the hill to
Lynton, but as we rise the surface becomes
quite good, and the gradient is nowhere so
steep as at the bottom. And from the top
of the cliff we look away across the heather
to the high uplands of Exmoor, and see below
us on the right the green cleft in the hills
that is the Doone Valley.</p>

<h3>VII<br />
THROUGH SOMERSET AGAIN</h3>

<p>Porlock is a word of dread significance
to those who are interested in the
roads of England. A precipitous hill nearly
three miles long, with a surface of sand
and stones and several sharp corners&mdash;such
is the vision that this name invokes. There
is, however, not the least necessity to lower
ourselves into Porlock on these alarming
gradients. Near the top of the hill there
is a private road that turns off to the left,
and may be used for the sum of one shilling.
It is narrow, and has a poor surface and two
“hairpin” turns, but it is nowhere steep, and
the woods through which it runs are entrancing.
The car slips gently down among
the birches and rowan-trees, and soon we see
the bay below us with its dark grey beach,
and Porlock under the hill.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 590px;" id="illus45">

<img src="images/illus45.jpg" width="590" height="400" alt="" />

<p class="caption">PORLOCK.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>The two roads join, and run into the village
together, at the corner where the “Ship” Inn
and the cottages round it, with their thatched
roofs and porches and gay creepers, make
a pretty picture with the green hill for
background. Indeed, all Porlock is made
of pretty pictures: an inland village could
hardly be more decorative. There was a time
when it was not an inland village, but a
favourite landing-place for visitors of various
nations but of one marauding aim. It does
not to-day appear a promising field for a
robber of any ambition, but time was, I
believe, when it was quite a stirring place,
with a royal palace and much prosperity.
When the Danes landed here in the night
they were routed to their ships with empty
hands: but when, a hundred and fifty years
later, no less a man than Harold Godwinson
sailed in from his exile in Ireland, he was
not content with plundering and burning
Porlock itself, but made it a centre for
expeditions. He built himself a fort here,
whence he could comfortably raid the country
that was afterwards his own kingdom. The
French invasion of the seventeenth century<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
turned out to be a false alarm, but none
the less the inhabitants arose as one man,
armed themselves valiantly with scythes and
pikes, and hurried away to Exeter to join
William of Orange&mdash;which seems an original
way of repelling invasion.</p>

<p>There is an interesting church here. The
alabaster figures of a knight and his lady
in elaborate headdresses represent Lord
Harington of Aldingham and his wife,
afterwards Lady Bonville; whose finely
carved garments and faces have been
thickly covered with deep-cut initials by
those who love antiquities as the Conqueror
loved the tall deer.</p>

<p>Those whose love of antiquities is of
another kind will find it worth their while
to run to the “Anchor” Inn at Porlock Weir,
where every room is rich in ancient furniture
and vessels of copper and brass. The road
that leads to it is excellent, and so is the
one that takes us on to Dunster, though the
redness of its surface adds a new terror to
dust. We pass through Allerford with a
fine view of the hills and a glimpse of the
old pack-horse bridge; but when we reach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
the by-way to Selworthy we shall do well to
turn aside. For this pretty lane, which is
roofed with foliage as completely as a
pergola, leads not only to an interesting
church and a tithe-barn, but to a group of
almshouses that is unequalled in its simple
way: half a dozen thatched and gabled
cottages ranged, not in a stiff row, but
round a sloping green, with wild woods to
shelter them, and walnut-trees to shade them,
and hollyhocks and fuchsias to make them
gay. Between them and the woods a tiny
stream trickles through the moss, and over
it a rough tree-stem has been flung to serve
as bridge.</p>

<p>After a few more miles on the fine red
road, with Dunkerry Hill conspicuous on
the right, we see, first Minehead lying by
the sea and spreading up the hill, and then
the watch-tower of Dunster. A minute later
we drive into the Middle Ages.</p>

<p>This street of Dunster makes one half in
love with the feudalism that could produce
so perfect a picture. On one side are the
porch and archway of the “Luttrell Arms”; on
the other the octagonal yarn-market, gabled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
and tiled and mossy, with a little mullioned
window in each gable; between them lies
the straight, wide street; and in the background,
dominating and protective, the castle
towers are lifted high upon their wooded
hill. Through all the centuries between
the Conquest and to-day this castle has had
no masters but the Mohuns and the Luttrells,
and there is nothing in Dunster that is not
connected, directly or indirectly, with one
of these two ancient names. These buildings
to right and left of us, for instance&mdash;this
inn with the mediæval porch and the beautiful
north wing, and this market-house that
used to be the scene of “a very celebrate
market at Dunstorre ons a wekes”&mdash;were
both built by George Luttrell of the sixteenth
century and repaired by George Luttrell of
the seventeenth. And if we walk down the
wide street and turn to the left we shall
find the church of the Mohuns’ priory, the
Benedictine priory that the first Mohun of
Dunster founded, “pricked by the fear of
God.”</p>

</div>

<p>It is a very notable church. “The late
priory of blake monkes,” says Leland, “stoode<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
yn the rootes of the north-west side of the
castelle, and was a celle to Bathe. The hole
chirch of the late priory servith now for
the paroche chirch. Afore tymes the monkes
had the est parte closid up to their use.” Of
late years the church has been restored to
the form it had aforetimes, with the seats
of the prior and monks, and the monastic
choir. The very beautiful rood-screen with
the canopy of fan-tracery, which was set up
in the fifteenth century, forms the entrance
to the parish choir: the choir of the monks
is reached through the curious arch that is
wider below than above&mdash;an arrangement
made by the brothers themselves to allow
room for their processions. Round about
the high altar of the priory are monuments
of the Luttrells. Thomas Luttrell, whose
great Elizabethan memorial is in the south-east
chapel, was the father of the man who
rebuilt the castle and did so much for
Dunster&mdash;George Luttrell, who kneels here
in effigy; and the slab that now lies under
the window of the south aisle once covered
the grave of the Lady Elizabeth who, as a
widow, bought the manor of Dunster from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
the widow of Sir John de Mohun. On the
north side of the altar is the alabaster
figure, though probably not the tomb, of
her son Sir Hugh, first Luttrell of Dunster,
Great Seneschal of Normandy, Steward of
the Household to Queen Joan, a warrior
who won much renown in fighting the
French and the great Glyndwr and the
little Perkin Warbeck. Most of the Mohuns
were buried at their abbey of Bruton, but
here in the monks’ choir, under a canopy,
is the figure of Dame Hawise, wife of the
second Sir Reynold de Mohun.</p>

<p>Near the church are some remains of the
monastic buildings: the refectory, the prior’s
apparently impregnable barn, a couple of
archways, and, in the vicarage garden, a
lovely thirteenth-century dovecot with a
tiled roof and hanging creepers.</p>

<p>Although the “glory of this toun rose by
the Moions,” and though the memory of
them is everywhere, it is so many centuries
since they went away to Cornwall&mdash;to Hall
near Fowey, and later to Boconnoc&mdash;that
there are few actual relics of them left.
Of the three castles that they built successively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
upon the hill there remains little
more than a gateway of the third, the gateway
with the massive door and the mighty
knocker of iron. It is just within the main
entrance, and strangely enough was built
by the husband of Dame Hawise, whose
tomb is the only Mohun monument in the
church. The castellated gatehouse itself is
the work of the first Luttrell of Dunster.
His descendants still live in the great red
dwelling-house with the martlets of the
Luttrells over the door, but by their kindness
we are allowed, with a guide, to climb
the steep path under the yew-hedge that
is sixty feet high; and to see the strange
half-tropical plants of the gardens, the cork-tree
and the lemon-tree upon the wall; and
then to climb still higher to the bowling-green
and look out upon the park and the
Severn Sea.</p>

<p>This was not always a bowling-green. It
was here that the keep stood till great
Robert Blake, as formidable on shore as at
sea, brought all his batteries against it, and
the Parliament finally dismantled it. The
whole castle, indeed, would have been ruined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
if it had not been wanted as a prison for
poor Mr. Prynne. Some years earlier, while
there was a royalist garrison in the castle,
young Prince Charles was sent hither for
safety; and here, as elsewhere, tradition
has assigned a certain Red Room to him,
for no other reason than that it contained
a hiding-hole.<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>There is a real delight, after all our experiences
on the rough precipitous hills of
Devon, in swinging away from Dunster on
a good and level road&mdash;the road that is on
the whole the best in Somerset. So pleasant
is it that some, no doubt, will stoutly refuse
to pause or turn aside for many a mile.
For others, however, the lure of ancient
stones is very strong; and these will leave
the highway more than once between
Dunster and Taunton. In Washford, for
instance, there is a turn to the right that
leads in a moment to the Abbey of Cleeve.
Here in a rough field stands the gatehouse
with the genial motto, <i>Patens porta esto,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
ulli claudaris honesto</i>, and the statue of
the abbey’s patron-saint, and upon the inner
side the crucifix and the tablet with the
builder’s name, Dovel. Poor William Dovel,
last abbot of Cleeve, had a sore heart when
he passed out under these pointed arches
that he had raised for others, not himself,
to use, and saw his own name overhead upon
the masonry, and remembered all his loving,
futile work upon the walls of his abbey.
It was a poor Cistercian house, with a small
income and no jewels nor golden chalices
to tempt a king; but even trifling sums
were acceptable to Henry, and though a
thousand marks were offered for “his
grasious goodnes,” the abbey was doomed.
So William Dovel went forth of this gate,
and with him “XVII prystes off very honest
lyffe and conversation,” who “kept alwayes
grett hospytalyte to the relyffe off the
countre.” There is much of Dovel’s work
in the buildings of the monastery. As we
enter the garth the western cloister is on
our left, with Perpendicular windows and
mossy roof; facing us are the little pointed
windows of the dormitory, and below them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
the Early English doorway of the vaulted
chapter-house. Dovel’s refectory, with timbered
roof and carved finials, is reached
by a staircase on the southern side of the
quadrangle, and behind it in a little garden
is a pavement of heraldic tiles, bearing the
arms of many benefactors. Of the church
hardly anything remains.</p>

<p class="caption">GATEHOUSE, CLEEVE ABBEY.</p>

</div>

<p>Our good road takes us on, through
Williton, to the foot of the Quantocks, with
the sea and the distant Welsh shore upon
the left. Beyond the railway we bear round
to the right and drive below the green and
purple slopes of the hills that were loved
and often trodden by Coleridge, and Wordsworth,
and Hazlitt, the hills on which the
writing of the <cite>Ancient Mariner</cite> was planned.
At Crowcombe among the trees there is a
tall cross in the village, and a beautiful one
in the churchyard, and a porch with fan-tracery.
About three miles beyond this we
may turn aside for a moment to Combe
Florey, and see the old red manor-house of
the Floreys with their three flowers over
the gateway, and the village where Sydney
Smith’s blue pills were a doubtful blessing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
and the church where he preached, and the
vicarage on the hill, where he tried to impose
upon his London visitors by fastening antlers
to his donkeys’ heads. It was here that
Henry Luttrell spent a day with him. “He
had not his usual soup-and-pattie look,”
wrote Sydney Smith, “but a sort of apple-pie
depression, as if he had been staying with
a clergyman.… He was very agreeable,
but spoke too lightly, I thought, of veal
soup.”<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>At Bishop’s Lydeard is a church that is
fine enough in itself to wile us from the
highway. The bishop who gave it its name
was the learned and literary Asser, who has
told us himself how King Alfred asked for
his friendship, which indeed seems to have
been worth having. “He asked me eagerly
to devote myself to his service and become
his friend, to leave everything I possessed …
and he promised he would give me more than
an equivalent for it in his own dominions.”
This manor of Bishop’s Lydeard was part
of the equivalent he gave, when Asser, after
some hesitation, left St. David’s and came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
to be Bishop of Sherborne. Having forsaken
the main road to see the splendid
tower of this church, and the painted screen
and bench-ends, and the tall cross in the
churchyard, we may as well drive on a little
further to the very foot of the wooded Quantocks,
to the church and manor-house of
Cothelstone. For many centuries this land
was owned by the Stawells, who have left
their cross-lozengy above the house-door
and in the church; and in later years it
became the home of Shelley’s blue-eyed
daughter, Ianthe. As we pass the outer
gateway, on which two of Jeffreys’ victims
swung in Lord Stawell’s despite, we can
catch a glimpse of the inner gatehouse and
of the red-tiled roof and Jacobean doorway
beyond. This is but a fragment of the
old manor-house, for when that “loftie
proud man,” Sir John, raised four troops
for Charles I. he was sent to prison for it,
and his house was brought low by Blake.</p>

<p>There is a letter still existing, yellow now
with age and very fragile at the folds,
in which Sir John’s bailiff writes to him
piteously concerning this disaster. “The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
cruell and base dealyng,” he says, “wch
is now acted at Cothelstone doth astonish
and amaze all people wch do either see it
or heare of it; for they have now taken
downe all the Leads of the house … and
have already taken downe that part of
the house wch is over against my Ladye’s
garden.… I am very sorry that ther is
occasion gyven me to make soe sadd a
relation unto you.… I beseech God to send
us better tymes.” It was in the eighteenth
century that this restored wing of the old
house passed to the Esdailes, ancestors of
that Edward Esdaile who married Shelley’s
daughter.</p>

<p>Behind the house is the church that was
once the private chapel. It has some carved
bench-ends and some old glass, but its
special features are the two beautiful tombs
in the south chapel: the finely carved figures
of a fourteenth-century Stawell and his
wife, with their painted shields below them,
and the still more beautiful Elizabethan
tomb with the effigies of marble. In a
corner of the churchyard is a white stone
“in sweet memory of Ianthe.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>Again we return to our high-road, and
this time do not pause till we drive into
the market-place of Taunton, the quiet
centre of a country-town, where cabbages
are bought and sold, and loitering cabmen
smoke their pipes without a thought of
Monmouth or of Jeffreys. Yet some of
these very houses were wreathed with
flowers at the coming of the foolish duke:
here where the fountain is he stood and
smiled while the pious maids of Taunton,
made rebels by his handsome face, gave
him a Bible, and a fine banner of their
own working, “One would have thought
the people’s wits were flown away in the
flights of their joy.” Here he was proclaimed
King James and called King Monmouth,
and here his followers paid for their ill-placed
devotion in torrents of blood. Into
this market-place came Kirke and his Lambs
with their victims in chains; and over there
at the corner of Fore Street and High
Street stood the “White Hart,” whose signpost
was the gibbet. Hither came Jeffreys
of the sinister face. “He breathed death
like a destroying angel,” says Toulmin, “and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
ensanguined his very ermines with blood.
The victims remained unburied; the houses
and steeples were covered with their heads,
and the trees laden almost as thick with
quarters as with leaves.” He went in to
his monstrous work through that arch with
the embattled towers; and passed on through
the inner entrance of yellow stone, where
Henry VII.’s shield and Bishop Langton’s
are above the door. Within it is the great
hall, with the timbered roof and the whitewashed
walls that were hung with scarlet
while Jeffreys, “mostly drunk,” stormed at
his victims of the Bloody Assizes. The
little girl&mdash;she was hardly more than a
child&mdash;who had won Monmouth’s easy smiles
by her speech among the June flowers in
the market-place was ransomed with her
schoolfellows; but her sister had seen the
Judge’s face, and died of the terror of it.</p>

<p class="caption">TAUNTON CASTLE.</p>

</div>

<p>Such are some of the memories of quiet,
prosperous Taunton. Nor is the rest of its
long history much more placid. The eighth-century
castle of wood to which King Ina
of the West Saxons called his “fatherhood,
aldermen, and wisest commons, with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
godly men of his kingdom, to consult of great
and weighty matters,” only survived for
twenty-one years. In the twelfth century
the Bishop of Winchester built another, which
was improved and enlarged by his successors,
and has partly weathered the many storms
and stresses of its long experience: Wars
of the Roses, invasion by Perkin, and the
siege of the Civil War. Taunton held for the
Parliament, consistently, but at the first not
very stoutly. No sooner did the royalists
come near the town, says Clarendon, than
two “substantial inhabitants” were sent out
to treat with the general; while the garrison
settled the matter by departing, like Perkin
on a former occasion from the same castle,
“with wonderful celerity.” A year later,
however, the Parliament took Taunton again,
and making Blake its defender, kept it. For
Blake, who afterwards summed up a sailor’s
duty in memorable words&mdash;“It is not for us
to mind state affairs, but to keep the
foreigners from fooling us”&mdash;knew the duty
of a soldier too. “As we neither fear
your menaces nor accept your proffers,” he
answered the summons to surrender, “so we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
wish you for time to come to desist from
all overtures of the like nature unto us.”
Wyndham, Goring, Hopton, Grenville, all did
their utmost in vain. It remained for Charles
II.’s spite to ruin Taunton’s defences. The
castle that defied the King was dismantled,
and the town-walls utterly wiped away.</p>

<p>Of the Augustinian Priory that was founded
by Bishop Giffard of Winchester and supported
by so many noteworthy people&mdash;by
Henry de Blois and the Mohuns, Montacutes
and Arundels, William of Wykeham and
Jasper Tudor&mdash;there is nothing left but a
barn, the priory church of St. James, and the
splendid chapel of St. Mary Magdalen, now
the parish church. The graceful tower from
which Macaulay looked out over a land flowing
with milk and honey was shortly afterwards
taken down, but the present one, with
its three tiers of Decorated windows and its
pinnacles and parapet, is exactly copied, it is
said, from the original.</p>

<p>From Taunton we pass, through pretty
undulating country, by way of Hatch
Beauchamp to Ilminster. After the wild
scenery of Devon this quiet land is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
exciting; but there are pleasant woods here
and there, and the villages of Somerset need
fear no comparisons with any in England.
The towns are less attractive, except in the
matter of churches. Ilminster, for instance,
is clean and old-fashioned, but has no real
beauty save the church of yellow stone with
the fine tower. When Monmouth made his
successful progress through this country in
his youth, from hospitable house to flower-strewn
town, he came to this church one
Sunday morning from White Lackington.
He saw the tower with the triple windows
and Sir William Wadham’s fifteenth-century
transepts; but the nave has been rebuilt since
then, and betrays the fact. In the northern
transept is the enormous tomb of the builder,
inlaid with brasses; and near it is the
ponderous but unlovely monument of
Nicholas and Dorothy Wadham, founders
of Wadham College. They “lie both interr’d
under a stately monument,” says Prince,
“now much defaced, the greater is the pity,
by the rude hands of children and time.”</p>

<p>At the outskirts of the town is Dillington
House, where Mr. Speke entertained the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
popular duke when he came to Ilminster.
We pass the entrance to the park as we drive
out upon the road to Yeovil&mdash;the park whose
palings were broken down by the crowd that
surged about Monmouth, when he rode in
with his self-constituted bodyguard of two
thousand horsemen. Our progress, if greeted
with less enthusiasm than his, is quicker. We
spin through dull scenery upon a splendid
road till the bluff outline of Hamdon Hill
comes into sight. For a moment we touch
the Fosse Way, then swing slowly round the
base of the hill through Stoke, and see St.
Michael’s Tower above us on the right.</p>

<p>It was this sugar-loaf hill that prompted
William de Mortain the swashbuckler to name
his castle Montacute, when he built it where
the tower now stands. His father Robert
de Mortain, who had come successfully
through many battles with the standard of
St. Michael borne before him, regarded that
saint as the particular patron of his family.
It was he who dedicated “the guarded
Mount” in Cornwall and gave the monastery
to its namesake in Normandy, “for the health
of his soul.” His son, whose piety was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
peculiarly spasmodic, not only built his castle
here, but founded the Cluniac priory whose
lovely fifteenth-century gatehouse still stands
at the foot of the hill. Everything at Montacute
is lovely: this gatehouse with the oriel
windows and the towers and creepers: the
church with its many styles of architecture,
from Norman to Decorated: the village square
with its houses of warm yellow stone, and
all its windows made beautiful with drip-stones
and mullions: above all, the splendid
Tudor front of Montacute House, and its
formal, parapeted garden.</p>

<p>The Summer-land, as we leave it, is not
beautiful, nor is Yeovil an interesting town.
But the road is very good; the engine is
singing softly; and as for us&mdash;we are remembering.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.</p>

<p>Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

<h2>START: FULL LICENSE<br />
<br />
THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE<br />
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</h2>

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.</p>

<h3>Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
